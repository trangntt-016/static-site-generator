<body><h1>The Naval Treaty</h1><br/><br/><p>The July which immediately succeeded my marriage was made</p><p>memorable by three cases of interest, in which I had the</p><p>privilege of being associated with Sherlock Holmes and of</p><p>studying his methods. I find them recorded in my notes under the</p><p>headings of â€œThe Adventure of the Second Stain,â€? â€œThe Adventure</p><p>of the Naval Treaty,â€? and â€œThe Adventure of the Tired Captain.â€?</p><p>The first of these, however, deals with interest of such</p><p>importance and implicates so many of the first families in the</p><p>kingdom that for many years it will be impossible to make it</p><p>public. No case, however, in which Holmes was engaged has ever</p><p>illustrated the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has</p><p>impressed those who were associated with him so deeply. I still</p><p>retain an almost verbatim report of the interview in which he</p><p>demonstrated the true facts of the case to Monsieur Dubuque of</p><p>the Paris police, and Fritz von Waldbaum, the well-known</p><p>specialist of Dantzig, both of whom had wasted their energies</p><p>upon what proved to be side-issues. The new century will have</p><p>come, however, before the story can be safely told. Meanwhile I</p><p>pass on to the second on my list, which promised also at one time</p><p>to be of national importance, and was marked by several incidents</p><p>which give it a quite unique character.</p><br/><p>During my school-days I had been intimately associated with a lad</p><p>named Percy Phelps, who was of much the same age as myself,</p><p>though he was two classes ahead of me. He was a very brilliant</p><p>boy, and carried away every prize which the school had to offer,</p><p>finished his exploits by winning a scholarship which sent him on</p><p>to continue his triumphant career at Cambridge. He was, I</p><p>remember, extremely well connected, and even when we were all</p><p>little boys together we knew that his motherâ€™s brother was Lord</p><p>Holdhurst, the great conservative politician. This gaudy</p><p>relationship did him little good at school. On the contrary, it</p><p>seemed rather a piquant thing to us to chevy him about the</p><p>playground and hit him over the shins with a wicket. But it was</p><p>another thing when he came out into the world. I heard vaguely</p><p>that his abilities and the influences which he commanded had won</p><p>him a good position at the Foreign Office, and then he passed</p><p>completely out of my mind until the following letter recalled his</p><p>existence:</p><br/><p>Briarbrae, Woking.</p><p>    My dear Watson,â€”I have no doubt that you can remember</p><p>    â€œTadpoleâ€? Phelps, who was in the fifth form when you were in</p><p>    the third. It is possible even that you may have heard that</p><p>    through my uncleâ€™s influence I obtained a good appointment at</p><p>    the Foreign Office, and that I was in a situation of trust</p><p>    and honour until a horrible misfortune came suddenly to blast</p><p>    my career.</p><p>    There is no use writing of the details of that dreadful</p><p>    event. In the event of your acceding to my request it is</p><p>    probable that I shall have to narrate them to you. I have</p><p>    only just recovered from nine weeks of brain-fever, and am</p><p>    still exceedingly weak. Do you think that you could bring</p><p>    your friend Mr. Holmes down to see me? I should like to have</p><p>    his opinion of the case, though the authorities assure me</p><p>    that nothing more can be done. Do try to bring him down, and</p><p>    as soon as possible. Every minute seems an hour while I live</p><p>    in this state of horrible suspense. Assure him that if I have</p><p>    not asked his advice sooner it was not because I did not</p><p>    appreciate his talents, but because I have been off my head</p><p>    ever since the blow fell. Now I am clear again, though I dare</p><p>    not think of it too much for fear of a relapse. I am still so</p><p>    weak that I have to write, as you see, by dictating. Do try</p><p>    to bring him.</p><br/><p>Your old schoolfellow,</p><p>Percy Phelps.</p><br/><p>There was something that touched me as I read this letter,</p><p>something pitiable in the reiterated appeals to bring Holmes. So</p><p>moved was I that even had it been a difficult matter I should</p><p>have tried it, but of course I knew well that Holmes loved his</p><p>art, so that he was ever as ready to bring his aid as his client</p><p>could be to receive it. My wife agreed with me that not a moment</p><p>should be lost in laying the matter before him, and so within an</p><p>hour of breakfast-time I found myself back once more in the old</p><p>rooms in Baker Street.</p><br/><p>Holmes was seated at his side-table clad in his dressing-gown,</p><p>and working hard over a chemical investigation. A large curved</p><p>retort was boiling furiously in the bluish flame of a Bunsen</p><p>burner, and the distilled drops were condensing into a two-litre</p><p>measure. My friend hardly glanced up as I entered, and I, seeing</p><p>that his investigation must be of importance, seated myself in an</p><p>armchair and waited. He dipped into this bottle or that, drawing</p><p>out a few drops of each with his glass pipette, and finally</p><p>brought a test-tube containing a solution over to the table. In</p><p>his right hand he held a slip of litmus-paper.</p><br/><p>â€œYou come at a crisis, Watson,â€? said he. â€œIf this paper remains</p><p>blue, all is well. If it turns red, it means a manâ€™s life.â€? He</p><p>dipped it into the test-tube and it flushed at once into a dull,</p><p>dirty crimson. â€œHum! I thought as much!â€? he cried. â€œI will be at</p><p>your service in an instant, Watson. You will find tobacco in the</p><p>Persian slipper.â€? He turned to his desk and scribbled off several</p><p>telegrams, which were handed over to the page-boy. Then he threw</p><p>himself down into the chair opposite, and drew up his knees until</p><p>his fingers clasped round his long, thin shins.</p><br/><p>â€œA very commonplace little murder,â€? said he. â€œYouâ€™ve got</p><p>something better, I fancy. You are the stormy petrel of crime,</p><p>Watson. What is it?â€?</p><br/><p>I handed him the letter, which he read with the most concentrated</p><p>attention.</p><br/><p>â€œIt does not tell us very much, does it?â€? he remarked, as he</p><p>handed it back to me.</p><br/><p>â€œHardly anything.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAnd yet the writing is of interest.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œBut the writing is not his own.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œPrecisely. It is a womanâ€™s.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œA manâ€™s surely,â€? I cried.</p><br/><p>â€œNo, a womanâ€™s, and a woman of rare character. You see, at the</p><p>commencement of an investigation it is something to know that</p><p>your client is in close contact with some one who, for good or</p><p>evil, has an exceptional nature. My interest is already awakened</p><p>in the case. If you are ready we will start at once for Woking,</p><p>and see this diplomatist who is in such evil case, and the lady</p><p>to whom he dictates his letters.â€?</p><br/><p>We were fortunate enough to catch an early train at Waterloo, and</p><p>in a little under an hour we found ourselves among the fir-woods</p><p>and the heather of Woking. Briarbrae proved to be a large</p><p>detached house standing in extensive grounds within a few</p><p>minutesâ€™ walk of the station. On sending in our cards we were</p><p>shown into an elegantly appointed drawing-room, where we were</p><p>joined in a few minutes by a rather stout man who received us</p><p>with much hospitality. His age may have been nearer forty than</p><p>thirty, but his cheeks were so ruddy and his eyes so merry that</p><p>he still conveyed the impression of a plump and mischievous boy.</p><br/><p>â€œI am so glad that you have come,â€? said he, shaking our hands</p><p>with effusion. â€œPercy has been inquiring for you all morning. Ah,</p><p>poor old chap, he clings to any straw! His father and his mother</p><p>asked me to see you, for the mere mention of the subject is very</p><p>painful to them.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWe have had no details yet,â€? observed Holmes. â€œI perceive that</p><p>you are not yourself a member of the family.â€?</p><br/><p>Our acquaintance looked surprised, and then, glancing down, he</p><p>began to laugh.</p><br/><p>â€œOf course you saw the â€˜J.H.â€™ monogram on my locket,â€? said he.</p><p>â€œFor a moment I thought you had done something clever. Joseph</p><p>Harrison is my name, and as Percy is to marry my sister Annie I</p><p>shall at least be a relation by marriage. You will find my sister</p><p>in his room, for she has nursed him hand-and-foot this two months</p><p>back. Perhaps weâ€™d better go in at once, for I know how impatient</p><p>he is.â€?</p><br/><p>The chamber in which we were shown was on the same floor as the</p><p>drawing-room. It was furnished partly as a sitting and partly as</p><p>a bedroom, with flowers arranged daintily in every nook and</p><p>corner. A young man, very pale and worn, was lying upon a sofa</p><p>near the open window, through which came the rich scent of the</p><p>garden and the balmy summer air. A woman was sitting beside him,</p><p>who rose as we entered.</p><br/><p>â€œShall I leave, Percy?â€? she asked.</p><br/><p>He clutched her hand to detain her. â€œHow are you, Watson?â€? said</p><p>he, cordially. â€œI should never have known you under that</p><p>moustache, and I daresay you would not be prepared to swear to</p><p>me. This I presume is your celebrated friend, Mr. Sherlock</p><p>Holmes?â€?</p><br/><p>I introduced him in a few words, and we both sat down. The stout</p><p>young man had left us, but his sister still remained with her</p><p>hand in that of the invalid. She was a striking-looking woman, a</p><p>little short and thick for symmetry, but with a beautiful olive</p><p>complexion, large, dark, Italian eyes, and a wealth of deep black</p><p>hair. Her rich tints made the white face of her companion the</p><p>more worn and haggard by the contrast.</p><br/><p>â€œI wonâ€™t waste your time,â€? said he, raising himself upon the</p><p>sofa. â€œIâ€™ll plunge into the matter without further preamble. I</p><p>was a happy and successful man, Mr. Holmes, and on the eve of</p><p>being married, when a sudden and dreadful misfortune wrecked all</p><p>my prospects in life.</p><br/><p>â€œI was, as Watson may have told you, in the Foreign Office, and</p><p>through the influences of my uncle, Lord Holdhurst, I rose</p><p>rapidly to a responsible position. When my uncle became foreign</p><p>minister in this administration he gave me several missions of</p><p>trust, and as I always brought them to a successful conclusion,</p><p>he came at last to have the utmost confidence in my ability and</p><p>tact.</p><br/><p>â€œNearly ten weeks agoâ€”to be more accurate, on the 23rd of Mayâ€”he</p><p>called me into his private room, and, after complimenting me on</p><p>the good work which I had done, he informed me that he had a new</p><p>commission of trust for me to execute.</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜This,â€™ said he, taking a grey roll of paper from his bureau,</p><p>â€˜is the original of that secret treaty between England and Italy</p><p>of which, I regret to say, some rumours have already got into the</p><p>public press. It is of enormous importance that nothing further</p><p>should leak out. The French or the Russian embassy would pay an</p><p>immense sum to learn the contents of these papers. They should</p><p>not leave my bureau were it not that it is absolutely necessary</p><p>to have them copied. You have a desk in your office?â€™</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜Yes, sir.â€™</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜Then take the treaty and lock it up there. I shall give</p><p>directions that you may remain behind when the others go, so that</p><p>you may copy it at your leisure without fear of being overlooked.</p><p>When you have finished, relock both the original and the draft in</p><p>the desk, and hand them over to me personally to-morrow morning.â€™</p><br/><p>â€œI took the papers andâ€”â€?</p><br/><p>â€œExcuse me an instant,â€? said Holmes. â€œWere you alone during this</p><p>conversation?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAbsolutely.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIn a large room?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThirty feet each way.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIn the centre?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYes, about it.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAnd speaking low?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œMy uncleâ€™s voice is always remarkably low. I hardly spoke at</p><p>all.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThank you,â€? said Holmes, shutting his eyes; â€œpray go on.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI did exactly what he indicated, and waited until the other</p><p>clerks had departed. One of them in my room, Charles Gorot, had</p><p>some arrears of work to make up, so I left him there and went out</p><p>to dine. When I returned he was gone. I was anxious to hurry my</p><p>work, for I knew that Josephâ€”the Mr. Harrison whom you saw just</p><p>nowâ€”was in town, and that he would travel down to Woking by the</p><p>eleven oâ€™clock train, and I wanted if possible to catch it.</p><br/><p>â€œWhen I came to examine the treaty I saw at once that it was of</p><p>such importance that my uncle had been guilty of no exaggeration</p><p>in what he had said. Without going into details, I may say that</p><p>it defined the position of Great Britain towards the Triple</p><p>Alliance, and fore-shadowed the policy which this country would</p><p>pursue in the event of the French fleet gaining a complete</p><p>ascendancy over that of Italy in the Mediterranean. The questions</p><p>treated in it were purely naval. At the end were the signatures</p><p>of the high dignitaries who had signed it. I glanced my eyes over</p><p>it, and then settled down to my task of copying.</p><br/><p>â€œIt was a long document, written in the French language, and</p><p>containing twenty-six separate articles. I copied as quickly as I</p><p>could, but at nine oâ€™clock I had only done nine articles, and it</p><p>seemed hopeless for me to attempt to catch my train. I was</p><p>feeling drowsy and stupid, partly from my dinner and also from</p><p>the effects of a long dayâ€™s work. A cup of coffee would clear my</p><p>brain. A commissionnaire remains all night in a little lodge at</p><p>the foot of the stairs, and is in the habit of making coffee at</p><p>his spirit-lamp for any of the officials who may be working over</p><p>time. I rang the bell, therefore, to summon him.</p><br/><p>â€œTo my surprise, it was a woman who answered the summons, a</p><p>large, coarse-faced, elderly woman, in an apron. She explained</p><p>that she was the commissionnaireâ€™s wife, who did the charing, and</p><p>I gave her the order for the coffee.</p><br/><p>â€œI wrote two more articles and then, feeling more drowsy than</p><p>ever, I rose and walked up and down the room to stretch my legs.</p><p>My coffee had not yet come, and I wondered what the cause of the</p><p>delay could be. Opening the door, I started down the corridor to</p><p>find out. There was a straight passage, dimly lighted, which led</p><p>from the room in which I had been working, and was the only exit</p><p>from it. It ended in a curving staircase, with the</p><p>commissionnaireâ€™s lodge in the passage at the bottom. Half-way</p><p>down this staircase is a small landing, with another passage</p><p>running into it at right angles. This second one leads by means</p><p>of a second small stair to a side door, used by servants, and</p><p>also as a short cut by clerks when coming from Charles Street.</p><p>Here is a rough chart of the place.â€?</p><br/><p>rough chart</p><br/><p>â€œThank you. I think that I quite follow you,â€? said Sherlock</p><p>Holmes.</p><br/><p>â€œIt is of the utmost importance that you should notice this</p><p>point. I went down the stairs and into the hall, where I found</p><p>the commissionnaire fast asleep in his box, with the kettle</p><p>boiling furiously upon the spirit-lamp. I took off the kettle and</p><p>blew out the lamp, for the water was spurting over the floor.</p><p>Then I put out my hand and was about to shake the man, who was</p><p>still sleeping soundly, when a bell over his head rang loudly,</p><p>and he woke with a start.</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜Mr. Phelps, sir!â€™ said he, looking at me in bewilderment.</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜I came down to see if my coffee was ready.â€™</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜I was boiling the kettle when I fell asleep, sir.â€™ He looked at</p><p>me and then up at the still quivering bell with an ever-growing</p><p>astonishment upon his face.</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜If you was here, sir, then who rang the bell?â€™ he asked.</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜The bell!â€™ I cried. â€˜What bell is it?â€™</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜Itâ€™s the bell of the room you were working in.â€™</p><br/><p>â€œA cold hand seemed to close round my heart. Some one, then, was</p><p>in that room where my precious treaty lay upon the table. I ran</p><p>frantically up the stairs and along the passage. There was no one</p><p>in the corridors, Mr. Holmes. There was no one in the room. All</p><p>was exactly as I left it, save only that the papers which had</p><p>been committed to my care had been taken from the desk on which</p><p>they lay. The copy was there, and the original was gone.â€?</p><br/><p>Holmes sat up in his chair and rubbed his hands. I could see that</p><p>the problem was entirely to his heart. â€œPray, what did you do</p><p>then?â€? he murmured.</p><br/><p>â€œI recognised in an instant that the thief must have come up the</p><p>stairs from the side door. Of course I must have met him if he</p><p>had come the other way.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYou were satisfied that he could not have been concealed in the</p><p>room all the time, or in the corridor which you have just</p><p>described as dimly lighted?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIt is absolutely impossible. A rat could not conceal himself</p><p>either in the room or the corridor. There is no cover at all.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThank you. Pray proceed.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThe commissionnaire, seeing by my pale face that something was</p><p>to be feared, had followed me upstairs. Now we both rushed along</p><p>the corridor and down the steep steps which led to Charles</p><p>Street. The door at the bottom was closed, but unlocked. We flung</p><p>it open and rushed out. I can distinctly remember that as we did</p><p>so there came three chimes from a neighbouring clock. It was</p><p>quarter to ten.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThat is of enormous importance,â€? said Holmes, making a note upon</p><p>his shirt-cuff.</p><br/><p>â€œThe night was very dark, and a thin, warm rain was falling.</p><p>There was no one in Charles Street, but a great traffic was going</p><p>on, as usual, in Whitehall, at the extremity. We rushed along the</p><p>pavement, bare-headed as we were, and at the far corner we found</p><p>a policeman standing.</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜A robbery has been committed,â€™ I gasped. â€˜A document of immense</p><p>value has been stolen from the Foreign Office. Has any one passed</p><p>this way?â€™</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜I have been standing here for a quarter of an hour, sir,â€™ said</p><p>he; â€˜only one person has passed during that timeâ€”a woman, tall</p><p>and elderly, with a Paisley shawl.â€™</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜Ah, that is only my wife,â€™ cried the commissionnaire; â€˜has no</p><p>one else passed?â€™</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜No one.â€™</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜Then it must be the other way that the thief took,â€™ cried the</p><p>fellow, tugging at my sleeve.</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜But I was not satisfied, and the attempts which he made to draw</p><p>me away increased my suspicions.</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜Which way did the woman go?â€™ I cried.</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜I donâ€™t know, sir. I noticed her pass, but I had no special</p><p>reason for watching her. She seemed to be in a hurry.â€™</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜How long ago was it?â€™</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜Oh, not very many minutes.â€™</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜Within the last five?â€™</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜Well, it could not be more than five.â€™</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜Youâ€™re only wasting your time, sir, and every minute now is of</p><p>importance,â€™ cried the commissionnaire; â€˜take my word for it that</p><p>my old woman has nothing to do with it, and come down to the</p><p>other end of the street. Well, if you wonâ€™t, I will.â€™ And with</p><p>that he rushed off in the other direction.</p><br/><p>â€œBut I was after him in an instant and caught him by the sleeve.</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜Where do you live?â€™ said I.</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜16 Ivy Lane, Brixton,â€™ he answered. â€˜But donâ€™t let yourself be</p><p>drawn away upon a false scent, Mr. Phelps. Come to the other end</p><p>of the street and let us see if we can hear of anything.â€™</p><br/><p>â€œNothing was to be lost by following his advice. With the</p><p>policeman we both hurried down, but only to find the street full</p><p>of traffic, many people coming and going, but all only too eager</p><p>to get to a place of safety upon so wet a night. There was no</p><p>lounger who could tell us who had passed.</p><br/><p>â€œThen we returned to the office, and searched the stairs and the</p><p>passage without result. The corridor which led to the room was</p><p>laid down with a kind of creamy linoleum which shows an</p><p>impression very easily. We examined it very carefully, but found</p><p>no outline of any footmark.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œHad it been raining all evening?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œSince about seven.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œHow is it, then, that the woman who came into the room about</p><p>nine left no traces with her muddy boots?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI am glad you raised the point. It occurred to me at the time.</p><p>The charwomen are in the habit of taking off their boots at the</p><p>commissionnaireâ€™s office, and putting on list slippers.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThat is very clear. There were no marks, then, though the night</p><p>was a wet one? The chain of events is certainly one of</p><p>extraordinary interest. What did you do next?</p><br/><p>â€œWe examined the room also. There is no possibility of a secret</p><p>door, and the windows are quite thirty feet from the ground. Both</p><p>of them were fastened on the inside. The carpet prevents any</p><p>possibility of a trap-door, and the ceiling is of the ordinary</p><p>whitewashed kind. I will pledge my life that whoever stole my</p><p>papers could only have come through the door.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œHow about the fireplace?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThey use none. There is a stove. The bell-rope hangs from the</p><p>wire just to the right of my desk. Whoever rang it must have come</p><p>right up to the desk to do it. But why should any criminal wish</p><p>to ring the bell? It is a most insoluble mystery.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œCertainly the incident was unusual. What were your next steps?</p><p>You examined the room, I presume, to see if the intruder had left</p><p>any tracesâ€”any cigar-end or dropped glove or hairpin or other</p><p>trifle?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThere was nothing of the sort.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œNo smell?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, we never thought of that.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAh, a scent of tobacco would have been worth a great deal to us</p><p>in such an investigation.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI never smoke myself, so I think I should have observed it if</p><p>there had been any smell of tobacco. There was absolutely no clue</p><p>of any kind. The only tangible fact was that the</p><p>commissionnaireâ€™s wifeâ€”Mrs. Tangey was the nameâ€”had hurried out</p><p>of the place. He could give no explanation save that it was about</p><p>the time when the woman always went home. The policeman and I</p><p>agreed that our best plan would be to seize the woman before she</p><p>could get rid of the papers, presuming that she had them.</p><br/><p>â€œThe alarm had reached Scotland Yard by this time, and Mr.</p><p>Forbes, the detective, came round at once and took up the case</p><p>with a great deal of energy. We hired a hansom, and in half an</p><p>hour we were at the address which had been given to us. A young</p><p>woman opened the door, who proved to be Mrs. Tangeyâ€™s eldest</p><p>daughter. Her mother had not come back yet, and we were shown</p><p>into the front room to wait.</p><br/><p>â€œAbout ten minutes later a knock came at the door, and here we</p><p>made the one serious mistake for which I blame myself. Instead of</p><p>opening the door ourselves, we allowed the girl to do so. We</p><p>heard her say, â€˜Mother, there are two men in the house waiting to</p><p>see you,â€™ and an instant afterwards we heard the patter of feet</p><p>rushing down the passage. Forbes flung open the door, and we both</p><p>ran into the back room or kitchen, but the woman had got there</p><p>before us. She stared at us with defiant eyes, and then, suddenly</p><p>recognising me, an expression of absolute astonishment came over</p><p>her face.</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜Why, if it isnâ€™t Mr. Phelps, of the office!â€™ she cried.</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜Come, come, who did you think we were when you ran away from</p><p>us?â€™ asked my companion.</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜I thought you were the brokers,â€™ said she, â€˜we have had some</p><p>trouble with a tradesman.â€™</p><br/><p>â€œâ€˜Thatâ€™s not quite good enough,â€™ answered Forbes. â€˜We have reason</p><p>to believe that you have taken a paper of importance from the</p><p>Foreign Office, and that you ran in here to dispose of it. You</p><p>must come back with us to Scotland Yard to be searched.â€™</p><br/><p>â€œIt was in vain that she protested and resisted. A four-wheeler</p><p>was brought, and we all three drove back in it. We had first made</p><p>an examination of the kitchen, and especially of the kitchen</p><p>fire, to see whether she might have made away with the papers</p><p>during the instant that she was alone. There were no signs,</p><p>however, of any ashes or scraps. When we reached Scotland Yard</p><p>she was handed over at once to the female searcher. I waited in</p><p>an agony of suspense until she came back with her report. There</p><p>were no signs of the papers.</p><br/><p>â€œThen for the first time the horror of my situation came in its</p><p>full force. Hitherto I had been acting, and action had numbed</p><p>thought. I had been so confident of regaining the treaty at once</p><p>that I had not dared to think of what would be the consequence if</p><p>I failed to do so. But now there was nothing more to be done, and</p><p>I had leisure to realize my position. It was horrible. Watson</p><p>there would tell you that I was a nervous, sensitive boy at</p><p>school. It is my nature. I thought of my uncle and of his</p><p>colleagues in the Cabinet, of the shame which I had brought upon</p><p>him, upon myself, upon every one connected with me. What though I</p><p>was the victim of an extraordinary accident? No allowance is made</p><p>for accidents where diplomatic interests are at stake. I was</p><p>ruined, shamefully, hopelessly ruined. I donâ€™t know what I did. I</p><p>fancy I must have made a scene. I have a dim recollection of a</p><p>group of officials who crowded round me, endeavouring to soothe</p><p>me. One of them drove down with me to Waterloo, and saw me into</p><p>the Woking train. I believe that he would have come all the way</p><p>had it not been that Dr. Ferrier, who lives near me, was going</p><p>down by that very train. The doctor most kindly took charge of</p><p>me, and it was well he did so, for I had a fit in the station,</p><p>and before we reached home I was practically a raving maniac.</p><br/><p>â€œYou can imagine the state of things here when they were roused</p><p>from their beds by the doctorâ€™s ringing and found me in this</p><p>condition. Poor Annie here and my mother were broken-hearted. Dr.</p><p>Ferrier had just heard enough from the detective at the station</p><p>to be able to give an idea of what had happened, and his story</p><p>did not mend matters. It was evident to all that I was in for a</p><p>long illness, so Joseph was bundled out of this cheery bedroom,</p><p>and it was turned into a sick-room for me. Here I have lain, Mr.</p><p>Holmes, for over nine weeks, unconscious, and raving with</p><p>brain-fever. If it had not been for Miss Harrison here and for</p><p>the doctorâ€™s care I should not be speaking to you now. She has</p><p>nursed me by day and a hired nurse has looked after me by night,</p><p>for in my mad fits I was capable of anything. Slowly my reason</p><p>has cleared, but it is only during the last three days that my</p><p>memory has quite returned. Sometimes I wish that it never had.</p><p>The first thing that I did was to wire to Mr. Forbes, who had the</p><p>case in hand. He came out, and assures me that, though everything</p><p>has been done, no trace of a clue has been discovered. The</p><p>commissionnaire and his wife have been examined in every way</p><p>without any light being thrown upon the matter. The suspicions of</p><p>the police then rested upon young Gorot, who, as you may</p><p>remember, stayed over time in the office that night. His</p><p>remaining behind and his French name were really the only two</p><p>points which could suggest suspicion; but, as a matter of fact, I</p><p>did not begin work until he had gone, and his people are of</p><p>Huguenot extraction, but as English in sympathy and tradition as</p><p>you and I are. Nothing was found to implicate him in any way, and</p><p>there the matter dropped. I turn to you, Mr. Holmes, as</p><p>absolutely my last hope. If you fail me, then my honour as well</p><p>as my position are forever forfeited.â€?</p><br/><p>The invalid sank back upon his cushions, tired out by this long</p><p>recital, while his nurse poured him out a glass of some</p><p>stimulating medicine. Holmes sat silently, with his head thrown</p><p>back and his eyes closed, in an attitude which might seem</p><p>listless to a stranger, but which I knew betokened the most</p><p>intense self-absorption.</p><br/><p>â€œYou statement has been so explicit,â€? said he at last, â€œthat you</p><p>have really left me very few questions to ask. There is one of</p><p>the very utmost importance, however. Did you tell any one that</p><p>you had this special task to perform?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œNo one.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œNot Miss Harrison here, for example?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œNo. I had not been back to Woking between getting the order and</p><p>executing the commission.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAnd none of your people had by chance been to see you?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œNone.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œDid any of them know their way about in the office?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œOh, yes, all of them had been shown over it.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œStill, of course, if you said nothing to any one about the</p><p>treaty these inquiries are irrelevant.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI said nothing.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œDo you know anything of the commissionnaire?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œNothing except that he is an old soldier.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWhat regiment?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œOh, I have heardâ€”Coldstream Guards.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThank you. I have no doubt I can get details from Forbes. The</p><p>authorities are excellent at amassing facts, though they do not</p><p>always use them to advantage. What a lovely thing a rose is!â€?</p><br/><p>He walked past the couch to the open window, and held up the</p><p>drooping stalk of a moss-rose, looking down at the dainty blend</p><p>of crimson and green. It was a new phase of his character to me,</p><p>for I had never before seen him show any keen interest in natural</p><p>objects.</p><br/><p>â€œThere is nothing in which deduction is so necessary as in</p><p>religion,â€? said he, leaning with his back against the shutters.</p><p>â€œIt can be built up as an exact science by the reasoner. Our</p><p>highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to</p><p>rest in the flowers. All other things, our powers our desires,</p><p>our food, are all really necessary for our existence in the first</p><p>instance. But this rose is an extra. Its smell and its colour are</p><p>an embellishment of life, not a condition of it. It is only</p><p>goodness which gives extras, and so I say again that we have much</p><p>to hope from the flowers.â€?</p><br/><p>Percy Phelps and his nurse looked at Holmes during this</p><p>demonstration with surprise and a good deal of disappointment</p><p>written upon their faces. He had fallen into a reverie, with the</p><p>moss-rose between his fingers. It had lasted some minutes before</p><p>the young lady broke in upon it.</p><br/><p>â€œDo you see any prospect of solving this mystery, Mr. Holmes?â€?</p><p>she asked, with a touch of asperity in her voice.</p><br/><p>â€œOh, the mystery!â€? he answered, coming back with a start to the</p><p>realities of life. â€œWell, it would be absurd to deny that the</p><p>case is a very abstruse and complicated one, but I can promise</p><p>you that I will look into the matter and let you know any points</p><p>which may strike me.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œDo you see any clue?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYou have furnished me with seven, but, of course, I must test</p><p>them before I can pronounce upon their value.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYou suspect some one?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI suspect myself.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWhat!â€?</p><br/><p>â€œOf coming to conclusions too rapidly.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThen go to London and test your conclusions.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYour advice is very excellent, Miss Harrison,â€? said Holmes,</p><p>rising. â€œI think, Watson, we cannot do better. Do not allow</p><p>yourself to indulge in false hopes, Mr. Phelps. The affair is a</p><p>very tangled one.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI shall be in a fever until I see you again,â€? cried the</p><p>diplomatist.</p><br/><p>â€œWell, Iâ€™ll come out by the same train to-morrow, though itâ€™s</p><p>more than likely that my report will be a negative one.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œGod bless you for promising to come,â€? cried our client. â€œIt</p><p>gives me fresh life to know that something is being done. By the</p><p>way, I have had a letter from Lord Holdhurst.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œHa! What did he say?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œHe was cold, but not harsh. I daresay my severe illness</p><p>prevented him from being that. He repeated that the matter was of</p><p>the utmost importance, and added that no steps would be taken</p><p>about my futureâ€”by which he means, of course, my dismissalâ€”until</p><p>my health was restored and I had an opportunity of repairing my</p><p>misfortune.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, that was reasonable and considerate,â€? said Holmes. â€œCome,</p><p>Watson, for we have a good dayâ€™s work before us in town.â€?</p><br/><p>Mr. Joseph Harrison drove us down to the station, and we were</p><p>soon whirling up in a Portsmouth train. Holmes was sunk in</p><p>profound thought, and hardly opened his mouth until we had passed</p><p>Clapham Junction.</p><br/><p>â€œItâ€™s a very cheery thing to come into London by any of these</p><p>lines which run high, and allow you to look down upon the houses</p><p>like this.â€?</p><br/><p>I thought he was joking, for the view was sordid enough, but he</p><p>soon explained himself.</p><br/><p>â€œLook at those big, isolated clumps of building rising up above</p><p>the slates, like brick islands in a lead-coloured sea.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThe board-schools.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œLight-houses, my boy! Beacons of the future! Capsules with</p><p>hundreds of bright little seeds in each, out of which will spring</p><p>the wise, better England of the future. I suppose that man Phelps</p><p>does not drink?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI should not think so.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œNor should I, but we are bound to take every possibility into</p><p>account. The poor devil has certainly got himself into very deep</p><p>water, and itâ€™s a question whether we shall ever be able to get</p><p>him ashore. What did you think of Miss Harrison?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œA girl of strong character.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYes, but she is a good sort, or I am mistaken. She and her</p><p>brother are the only children of an iron-master somewhere up</p><p>Northumberland way. He got engaged to her when traveling last</p><p>winter, and she came down to be introduced to his people, with</p><p>her brother as escort. Then came the smash, and she stayed on to</p><p>nurse her lover, while brother Joseph, finding himself pretty</p><p>snug, stayed on too. Iâ€™ve been making a few independent</p><p>inquiries, you see. But to-day must be a day of inquiries.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œMy practiceâ€”â€? I began.</p><br/><p>â€œOh, if you find your own cases more interesting than mineâ€”â€? said</p><p>Holmes, with some asperity.</p><br/><p>â€œI was going to say that my practice could get along very well</p><p>for a day or two, since it is the slackest time in the year.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œExcellent,â€? said he, recovering his good-humour. â€œThen weâ€™ll</p><p>look into this matter together. I think that we should begin by</p><p>seeing Forbes. He can probably tell us all the details we want</p><p>until we know from what side the case is to be approached.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYou said you had a clue?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, we have several, but we can only test their value by</p><p>further inquiry. The most difficult crime to track is the one</p><p>which is purposeless. Now this is not purposeless. Who is it who</p><p>profits by it? There is the French ambassador, there is the</p><p>Russian, there is whoever might sell it to either of these, and</p><p>there is Lord Holdhurst.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œLord Holdhurst!â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, it is just conceivable that a statesman might find himself</p><p>in a position where he was not sorry to have such a document</p><p>accidentally destroyed.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œNot a statesman with the honourable record of Lord Holdhurst?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIt is a possibility and we cannot afford to disregard it. We</p><p>shall see the noble lord to-day and find out if he can tell us</p><p>anything. Meanwhile I have already set inquiries on foot.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAlready?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYes, I sent wires from Woking station to every evening paper in</p><p>London. This advertisement will appear in each of them.â€?</p><br/><p>He handed over a sheet torn from a note-book. On it was scribbled</p><p>in pencil:</p><br/><p>â€œÂ£10 Reward.â€”The number of the cab which dropped a fare at or</p><p>about the door of the Foreign Office in Charles Street at quarter</p><p>to ten in the evening of May 23rd. Apply 221B, Baker Street.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYou are confident that the thief came in a cab?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIf not, there is no harm done. But if Mr. Phelps is correct in</p><p>stating that there is no hiding-place either in the room or the</p><p>corridors, then the person must have come from outside. If he</p><p>came from outside on so wet a night, and yet left no trace of</p><p>damp upon the linoleum, which was examined within a few minutes</p><p>of his passing, then it is exceeding probable that he came in a</p><p>cab. Yes, I think that we may safely deduce a cab.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIt sounds plausible.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThat is one of the clues of which I spoke. It may lead us to</p><p>something. And then, of course, there is the bellâ€”which is the</p><p>most distinctive feature of the case. Why should the bell ring?</p><p>Was it the thief who did it out of bravado? Or was it some one</p><p>who was with the thief who did it in order to prevent the crime?</p><p>Or was it an accident? Or was itâ€”?â€? He sank back into the state</p><p>of intense and silent thought from which he had emerged; but it</p><p>seemed to me, accustomed as I was to his every mood, that some</p><p>new possibility had dawned suddenly upon him.</p><br/><p>It was twenty past three when we reached our terminus, and after</p><p>a hasty luncheon at the buffet we pushed on at once to Scotland</p><p>Yard. Holmes had already wired to Forbes, and we found him</p><p>waiting to receive usâ€”a small, foxy man with a sharp but by no</p><p>means amiable expression. He was decidedly frigid in his manner</p><p>to us, especially when he heard the errand upon which we had</p><p>come.</p><br/><p>â€œIâ€™ve heard of your methods before now, Mr. Holmes,â€? said he,</p><p>tartly. â€œYou are ready enough to use all the information that the</p><p>police can lay at your disposal, and then you try to finish the</p><p>case yourself and bring discredit on them.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œOn the contrary,â€? said Holmes, â€œout of my last fifty-three cases</p><p>my name has only appeared in four, and the police have had all</p><p>the credit in forty-nine. I donâ€™t blame you for not knowing this,</p><p>for you are young and inexperienced, but if you wish to get on in</p><p>your new duties you will work with me and not against me.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIâ€™d be very glad of a hint or two,â€? said the detective, changing</p><p>his manner. â€œIâ€™ve certainly had no credit from the case so far.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWhat steps have you taken?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œTangey, the commissionnaire, has been shadowed. He left the</p><p>Guards with a good character and we can find nothing against him.</p><p>His wife is a bad lot, though. I fancy she knows more about this</p><p>than appears.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œHave you shadowed her?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWe have set one of our women on to her. Mrs. Tangey drinks, and</p><p>our woman has been with her twice when she was well on, but she</p><p>could get nothing out of her.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI understand that they have had brokers in the house?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYes, but they were paid off.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWhere did the money come from?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThat was all right. His pension was due. They have not shown any</p><p>sign of being in funds.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWhat explanation did she give of having answered the bell when</p><p>Mr. Phelps rang for the coffee?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œShe said that her husband was very tired and she wished to</p><p>relieve him.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, certainly that would agree with his being found a little</p><p>later asleep in his chair. There is nothing against them then but</p><p>the womanâ€™s character. Did you ask her why she hurried away that</p><p>night? Her haste attracted the attention of the police</p><p>constable.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œShe was later than usual and wanted to get home.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œDid you point out to her that you and Mr. Phelps, who started at</p><p>least twenty minutes after her, got home before her?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œShe explains that by the difference between a â€˜bus and a</p><p>hansom.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œDid she make it clear why, on reaching her house, she ran into</p><p>the back kitchen?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œBecause she had the money there with which to pay off the</p><p>brokers.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œShe has at least an answer for everything. Did you ask her</p><p>whether in leaving she met any one or saw any one loitering about</p><p>Charles Street?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œShe saw no one but the constable.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, you seem to have cross-examined her pretty thoroughly.</p><p>What else have you done?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThe clerk Gorot has been shadowed all these nine weeks, but</p><p>without result. We can show nothing against him.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAnything else?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, we have nothing else to go uponâ€”no evidence of any kind.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œHave you formed a theory about how that bell rang?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, I must confess that it beats me. It was a cool hand,</p><p>whoever it was, to go and give the alarm like that.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYes, it was a queer thing to do. Many thanks to you for what you</p><p>have told me. If I can put the man into your hands you shall hear</p><p>from me. Come along, Watson.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWhere are we going to now?â€? I asked, as we left the office.</p><br/><p>â€œWe are now going to interview Lord Holdhurst, the cabinet</p><p>minister and future premier of England.â€?</p><br/><p>We were fortunate in finding that Lord Holdhurst was still in his</p><p>chambers in Downing Street, and on Holmes sending in his card we</p><p>were instantly shown up. The statesman received us with that</p><p>old-fashioned courtesy for which he is remarkable, and seated us</p><p>on the two luxuriant lounges on either side of the fireplace.</p><p>Standing on the rug between us, with his slight, tall figure, his</p><p>sharp features, thoughtful face, and curling hair prematurely</p><p>tinged with grey, he seemed to represent that not too common</p><p>type, a nobleman who is in truth noble.</p><br/><p>â€œYour name is very familiar to me, Mr. Holmes,â€? said he, smiling.</p><p>â€œAnd, of course, I cannot pretend to be ignorant of the object of</p><p>your visit. There has only been one occurrence in these offices</p><p>which could call for your attention. In whose interest are you</p><p>acting, may I ask?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIn that of Mr. Percy Phelps,â€? answered Holmes.</p><br/><p>â€œAh, my unfortunate nephew! You can understand that our kinship</p><p>makes it the more impossible for me to screen him in any way. I</p><p>fear that the incident must have a very prejudicial effect upon</p><p>his career.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œBut if the document is found?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAh, that, of course, would be different.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI had one or two questions which I wished to ask you, Lord</p><p>Holdhurst.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI shall be happy to give you any information in my power.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWas it in this room that you gave your instructions as to the</p><p>copying of the document?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIt was.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThen you could hardly have been overheard?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIt is out of the question.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œDid you ever mention to any one that it was your intention to</p><p>give any one the treaty to be copied?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œNever.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYou are certain of that?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAbsolutely.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, since you never said so, and Mr. Phelps never said so, and</p><p>nobody else knew anything of the matter, then the thiefâ€™s</p><p>presence in the room was purely accidental. He saw his chance and</p><p>he took it.â€?</p><br/><p>The statesman smiled. â€œYou take me out of my province there,â€?</p><p>said he.</p><br/><p>Holmes considered for a moment. â€œThere is another very important</p><p>point which I wish to discuss with you,â€? said he. â€œYou feared, as</p><p>I understand, that very grave results might follow from the</p><p>details of this treaty becoming known.â€?</p><br/><p>A shadow passed over the expressive face of the statesman. â€œVery</p><p>grave results indeed.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAnd have they occurred?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œNot yet.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIf the treaty had reached, let us say, the French or Russian</p><p>Foreign Office, you would expect to hear of it?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI should,â€? said Lord Holdhurst, with a wry face.</p><br/><p>â€œSince nearly ten weeks have elapsed, then, and nothing has been</p><p>heard, it is not unfair to suppose that for some reason the</p><p>treaty has not reached them.â€?</p><br/><p>Lord Holdhurst shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>â€œWe can hardly suppose, Mr. Holmes, that the thief took the</p><p>treaty in order to frame it and hang it up.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œPerhaps he is waiting for a better price.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIf he waits a little longer he will get no price at all. The</p><p>treaty will cease to be secret in a few months.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThat is most important,â€? said Holmes. â€œOf course, it is a</p><p>possible supposition that the thief has had a sudden illnessâ€”â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAn attack of brain-fever, for example?â€? asked the statesman,</p><p>flashing a swift glance at him.</p><br/><p>â€œI did not say so,â€? said Holmes, imperturbably. â€œAnd now, Lord</p><p>Holdhurst, we have already taken up too much of your valuable</p><p>time, and we shall wish you good-day.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œEvery success to your investigation, be the criminal who it</p><p>may,â€? answered the nobleman, as he bowed us out the door.</p><br/><p>â€œHeâ€™s a fine fellow,â€? said Holmes, as we came out into Whitehall.</p><p>â€œBut he has a struggle to keep up his position. He is far from</p><p>rich and has many calls. You noticed, of course, that his boots</p><p>had been resoled. Now, Watson, I wonâ€™t detain you from your</p><p>legitimate work any longer. I shall do nothing more to-day,</p><p>unless I have an answer to my cab advertisement. But I should be</p><p>extremely obliged to you if you would come down with me to Woking</p><p>to-morrow, by the same train which we took yesterday.â€?</p><br/><p>I met him accordingly next morning and we travelled down to</p><p>Woking together. He had had no answer to his advertisement, he</p><p>said, and no fresh light had been thrown upon the case. He had,</p><p>when he so willed it, the utter immobility of countenance of a</p><p>red Indian, and I could not gather from his appearance whether he</p><p>was satisfied or not with the position of the case. His</p><p>conversation, I remember, was about the Bertillon system of</p><p>measurements, and he expressed his enthusiastic admiration of the</p><p>French savant.</p><br/><p>We found our client still under the charge of his devoted nurse,</p><p>but looking considerably better than before. He rose from the</p><p>sofa and greeted us without difficulty when we entered.</p><br/><p>â€œAny news?â€? he asked, eagerly.</p><br/><p>â€œMy report, as I expected, is a negative one,â€? said Holmes. â€œI</p><p>have seen Forbes, and I have seen your uncle, and I have set one</p><p>or two trains of inquiry upon foot which may lead to something.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYou have not lost heart, then?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œBy no means.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œGod bless you for saying that!â€? cried Miss Harrison. â€œIf we keep</p><p>our courage and our patience the truth must come out.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWe have more to tell you than you have for us,â€? said Phelps,</p><p>reseating himself upon the couch.</p><br/><p>â€œI hoped you might have something.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYes, we have had an adventure during the night, and one which</p><p>might have proved to be a serious one.â€? His expression grew very</p><p>grave as he spoke, and a look of something akin to fear sprang up</p><p>in his eyes. â€œDo you know,â€? said he, â€œthat I begin to believe</p><p>that I am the unconscious centre of some monstrous conspiracy,</p><p>and that my life is aimed at as well as my honour?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAh!â€? cried Holmes.</p><br/><p>â€œIt sounds incredible, for I have not, as far as I know, an enemy</p><p>in the world. Yet from last nightâ€™s experience I can come to no</p><p>other conclusion.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œPray let me hear it.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYou must know that last night was the very first night that I</p><p>have ever slept without a nurse in the room. I was so much better</p><p>that I thought I could dispense with one. I had a night-light</p><p>burning, however. Well, about two in the morning I had sunk into</p><p>a light sleep when I was suddenly aroused by a slight noise. It</p><p>was like the sound which a mouse makes when it is gnawing a</p><p>plank, and I lay listening to it for some time under the</p><p>impression that it must come from that cause. Then it grew</p><p>louder, and suddenly there came from the window a sharp metallic</p><p>snick. I sat up in amazement. There could be no doubt what the</p><p>sounds were now. The first ones had been caused by some one</p><p>forcing an instrument through the slit between the sashes, and</p><p>the second by the catch being pressed back.</p><br/><p>â€œThere was a pause then for about ten minutes, as if the person</p><p>were waiting to see whether the noise had awakened me. Then I</p><p>heard a gentle creaking as the window was very slowly opened. I</p><p>could stand it no longer, for my nerves are not what they used to</p><p>be. I sprang out of bed and flung open the shutters. A man was</p><p>crouching at the window. I could see little of him, for he was</p><p>gone like a flash. He was wrapped in some sort of cloak which</p><p>came across the lower part of his face. One thing only I am sure</p><p>of, and that is that he had some weapon in his hand. It looked to</p><p>me like a long knife. I distinctly saw the gleam of it as he</p><p>turned to run.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThis is most interesting,â€? said Holmes. â€œPray what did you do</p><p>then?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI should have followed him through the open window if I had been</p><p>stronger. As it was, I rang the bell and roused the house. It</p><p>took me some little time, for the bell rings in the kitchen and</p><p>the servants all sleep upstairs. I shouted, however, and that</p><p>brought Joseph down, and he roused the others. Joseph and the</p><p>groom found marks on the bed outside the window, but the weather</p><p>has been so dry lately that they found it hopeless to follow the</p><p>trail across the grass. Thereâ€™s a place, however, on the wooden</p><p>fence which skirts the road which shows signs, they tell me, as</p><p>if some one had got over, and had snapped the top of the rail in</p><p>doing so. I have said nothing to the local police yet, for I</p><p>thought I had best have your opinion first.â€?</p><br/><p>This tale of our clientâ€™s appeared to have an extraordinary</p><p>effect upon Sherlock Holmes. He rose from his chair and paced</p><p>about the room in uncontrollable excitement.</p><br/><p>â€œMisfortunes never come single,â€? said Phelps, smiling, though it</p><p>was evident that his adventure had somewhat shaken him.</p><br/><p>â€œYou have certainly had your share,â€? said Holmes. â€œDo you think</p><p>you could walk round the house with me?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œOh, yes, I should like a little sunshine. Joseph will come,</p><p>too.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAnd I also,â€? said Miss Harrison.</p><br/><p>â€œI am afraid not,â€? said Holmes, shaking his head. â€œI think I must</p><p>ask you to remain sitting exactly where you are.â€?</p><br/><p>The young lady resumed her seat with an air of displeasure. Her</p><p>brother, however, had joined us and we set off all four together.</p><p>We passed round the lawn to the outside of the young</p><p>diplomatistâ€™s window. There were, as he had said, marks upon the</p><p>bed, but they were hopelessly blurred and vague. Holmes stopped</p><p>over them for an instant, and then rose shrugging his shoulders.</p><br/><p>â€œI donâ€™t think any one could make much of this,â€? said he. â€œLet us</p><p>go round the house and see why this particular room was chosen by</p><p>the burglar. I should have thought those larger windows of the</p><p>drawing-room and dining-room would have had more attractions for</p><p>him.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThey are more visible from the road,â€? suggested Mr. Joseph</p><p>Harrison.</p><br/><p>â€œAh, yes, of course. There is a door here which he might have</p><p>attempted. What is it for?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIt is the side entrance for trades-people. Of course it is</p><p>locked at night.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œHave you ever had an alarm like this before?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œNever,â€? said our client.</p><br/><p>â€œDo you keep plate in the house, or anything to attract</p><p>burglars?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œNothing of value.â€?</p><br/><p>Holmes strolled round the house with his hands in his pockets and</p><p>a negligent air which was unusual with him.</p><br/><p>â€œBy the way,â€? said he to Joseph Harrison, â€œyou found some place,</p><p>I understand, where the fellow scaled the fence. Let us have a</p><p>look at that!â€?</p><br/><p>The plump young man led us to a spot where the top of one of the</p><p>wooden rails had been cracked. A small fragment of the wood was</p><p>hanging down. Holmes pulled it off and examined it critically.</p><br/><p>â€œDo you think that was done last night? It looks rather old, does</p><p>it not?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, possibly so.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThere are no marks of any one jumping down upon the other side.</p><p>No, I fancy we shall get no help here. Let us go back to the</p><p>bedroom and talk the matter over.â€?</p><br/><p>Percy Phelps was walking very slowly, leaning upon the arm of his</p><p>future brother-in-law. Holmes walked swiftly across the lawn, and</p><p>we were at the open window of the bedroom long before the others</p><p>came up.</p><br/><p>â€œMiss Harrison,â€? said Holmes, speaking with the utmost intensity</p><p>of manner, â€œyou must stay where you are all day. Let nothing</p><p>prevent you from staying where you are all day. It is of the</p><p>utmost importance.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œCertainly, if you wish it, Mr. Holmes,â€? said the girl in</p><p>astonishment.</p><br/><p>â€œWhen you go to bed lock the door of this room on the outside and</p><p>keep the key. Promise to do this.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œBut Percy?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œHe will come to London with us.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAnd am I to remain here?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIt is for his sake. You can serve him. Quick! Promise!â€?</p><br/><p>She gave a quick nod of assent just as the other two came up.</p><br/><p>â€œWhy do you sit moping there, Annie?â€? cried her brother. â€œCome</p><p>out into the sunshine!â€?</p><br/><p>â€œNo, thank you, Joseph. I have a slight headache and this room is</p><p>deliciously cool and soothing.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWhat do you propose now, Mr. Holmes?â€? asked our client.</p><br/><p>â€œWell, in investigating this minor affair we must not lose sight</p><p>of our main inquiry. It would be a very great help to me if you</p><p>would come up to London with us.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAt once?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, as soon as you conveniently can. Say in an hour.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI feel quite strong enough, if I can really be of any help.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThe greatest possible.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œPerhaps you would like me to stay there to-night?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI was just going to propose it.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThen, if my friend of the night comes to revisit me, he will</p><p>find the bird flown. We are all in your hands, Mr. Holmes, and</p><p>you must tell us exactly what you would like done. Perhaps you</p><p>would prefer that Joseph came with us so as to look after me?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œOh, no; my friend Watson is a medical man, you know, and heâ€™ll</p><p>look after you. Weâ€™ll have our lunch here, if you will permit us,</p><p>and then we shall all three set off for town together.â€?</p><br/><p>It was arranged as he suggested, though Miss Harrison excused</p><p>herself from leaving the bedroom, in accordance with Holmesâ€™s</p><p>suggestion. What the object of my friendâ€™s manÅ“uvres was I could</p><p>not conceive, unless it were to keep the lady away from Phelps,</p><p>who, rejoiced by his returning health and by the prospect of</p><p>action, lunched with us in the dining-room. Holmes had a still</p><p>more startling surprise for us, however, for, after accompanying</p><p>us down to the station and seeing us into our carriage, he calmly</p><p>announced that he had no intention of leaving Woking.</p><br/><p>â€œThere are one or two small points which I should desire to clear</p><p>up before I go,â€? said he. â€œYour absence, Mr. Phelps, will in some</p><p>ways rather assist me. Watson, when you reach London you would</p><p>oblige me by driving at once to Baker Street with our friend</p><p>here, and remaining with him until I see you again. It is</p><p>fortunate that you are old schoolfellows, as you must have much</p><p>to talk over. Mr. Phelps can have the spare bedroom to-night, and</p><p>I will be with you in time for breakfast, for there is a train</p><p>which will take me into Waterloo at eight.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œBut how about our investigation in London?â€? asked Phelps,</p><p>ruefully.</p><br/><p>â€œWe can do that to-morrow. I think that just at present I can be</p><p>of more immediate use here.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYou might tell them at Briarbrae that I hope to be back</p><p>to-morrow night,â€? cried Phelps, as we began to move from the</p><p>platform.</p><br/><p>â€œI hardly expect to go back to Briarbrae,â€? answered Holmes, and</p><p>waved his hand to us cheerily as we shot out from the station.</p><br/><p>Phelps and I talked it over on our journey, but neither of us</p><p>could devise a satisfactory reason for this new development.</p><br/><p>â€œI suppose he wants to find out some clue as to the burglary last</p><p>night, if a burglar it was. For myself, I donâ€™t believe it was an</p><p>ordinary thief.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWhat is your own idea, then?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œUpon my word, you may put it down to my weak nerves or not, but</p><p>I believe there is some deep political intrigue going on around</p><p>me, and that for some reason that passes my understanding my life</p><p>is aimed at by the conspirators. It sounds high-flown and absurd,</p><p>but consider the facts! Why should a thief try to break in at a</p><p>bedroom window, where there could be no hope of any plunder, and</p><p>why should he come with a long knife in his hand?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYou are sure it was not a house-breakerâ€™s jimmy?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œOh, no, it was a knife. I saw the flash of the blade quite</p><p>distinctly.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œBut why on earth should you be pursued with such animosity?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAh, that is the question.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, if Holmes takes the same view, that would account for his</p><p>action, would it not? Presuming that your theory is correct, if</p><p>he can lay his hands upon the man who threatened you last night</p><p>he will have gone a long way towards finding who took the naval</p><p>treaty. It is absurd to suppose that you have two enemies, one of</p><p>whom robs you, while the other threatens your life.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œBut Holmes said that he was not going to Briarbrae.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI have known him for some time,â€? said I, â€œbut I never knew him</p><p>do anything yet without a very good reason,â€? and with that our</p><p>conversation drifted off on to other topics.</p><br/><p>But it was a weary day for me. Phelps was still weak after his</p><p>long illness, and his misfortune made him querulous and nervous.</p><p>In vain I endeavoured to interest him in Afghanistan, in India,</p><p>in social questions, in anything which might take his mind out of</p><p>the groove. He would always come back to his lost treaty,</p><p>wondering, guessing, speculating, as to what Holmes was doing,</p><p>what steps Lord Holdhurst was taking, what news we should have in</p><p>the morning. As the evening wore on his excitement became quite</p><p>painful.</p><br/><p>â€œYou have implicit faith in Holmes?â€? he asked.</p><br/><p>â€œI have seen him do some remarkable things.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œBut he never brought light into anything quite so dark as this?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œOh, yes; I have known him solve questions which presented fewer</p><p>clues than yours.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œBut not where such large interests are at stake?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI donâ€™t know that. To my certain knowledge he has acted on</p><p>behalf of three of the reigning houses of Europe in very vital</p><p>matters.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œBut you know him well, Watson. He is such an inscrutable fellow</p><p>that I never quite know what to make of him. Do you think he is</p><p>hopeful? Do you think he expects to make a success of it?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œHe has said nothing.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThat is a bad sign.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œOn the contrary, I have noticed that when he is off the trail he</p><p>generally says so. It is when he is on a scent and is not quite</p><p>absolutely sure yet that it is the right one that he is most</p><p>taciturn. Now, my dear fellow, we canâ€™t help matters by making</p><p>ourselves nervous about them, so let me implore you to go to bed</p><p>and so be fresh for whatever may await us to-morrow.â€?</p><br/><p>I was able at last to persuade my companion to take my advice,</p><p>though I knew from his excited manner that there was not much</p><p>hope of sleep for him. Indeed, his mood was infectious, for I lay</p><p>tossing half the night myself, brooding over this strange</p><p>problem, and inventing a hundred theories, each of which was more</p><p>impossible than the last. Why had Holmes remained at Woking? Why</p><p>had he asked Miss Harrison to remain in the sick-room all day?</p><p>Why had he been so careful not to inform the people at Briarbrae</p><p>that he intended to remain near them? I cudgelled my brains until</p><p>I fell asleep in the endeavour to find some explanation which</p><p>would cover all these facts.</p><br/><p>It was seven oâ€™clock when I awoke, and I set off at once for</p><p>Phelpsâ€™s room, to find him haggard and spent after a sleepless</p><p>night. His first question was whether Holmes had arrived yet.</p><br/><p>â€œHeâ€™ll be here when he promised,â€? said I, â€œand not an instant</p><p>sooner or later.â€?</p><br/><p>And my words were true, for shortly after eight a hansom dashed</p><p>up to the door and our friend got out of it. Standing in the</p><p>window we saw that his left hand was swathed in a bandage and</p><p>that his face was very grim and pale. He entered the house, but</p><p>it was some little time before he came upstairs.</p><br/><p>â€œHe looks like a beaten man,â€? cried Phelps.</p><br/><p>I was forced to confess that he was right. â€œAfter all,â€? said I,</p><p>â€œthe clue of the matter lies probably here in town.â€?</p><br/><p>Phelps gave a groan.</p><br/><p>â€œI donâ€™t know how it is,â€? said he, â€œbut I had hoped for so much</p><p>from his return. But surely his hand was not tied up like that</p><p>yesterday. What can be the matter?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYou are not wounded, Holmes?â€? I asked, as my friend entered the</p><p>room.</p><br/><p>â€œTut, it is only a scratch through my own clumsiness,â€? he</p><p>answered, nodding his good-mornings to us. â€œThis case of yours,</p><p>Mr. Phelps, is certainly one of the darkest which I have ever</p><p>investigated.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI feared that you would find it beyond you.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIt has been a most remarkable experience.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThat bandage tells of adventures,â€? said I. â€œWonâ€™t you tell us</p><p>what has happened?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAfter breakfast, my dear Watson. Remember that I have breathed</p><p>thirty miles of Surrey air this morning. I suppose that there has</p><p>been no answer from my cabman advertisement? Well, well, we</p><p>cannot expect to score every time.â€?</p><br/><p>The table was all laid, and just as I was about to ring Mrs.</p><p>Hudson entered with the tea and coffee. A few minutes later she</p><p>brought in three covers, and we all drew up to the table, Holmes</p><p>ravenous, I curious, and Phelps in the gloomiest state of</p><p>depression.</p><br/><p>â€œMrs. Hudson has risen to the occasion,â€? said Holmes, uncovering</p><p>a dish of curried chicken. â€œHer cuisine is a little limited, but</p><p>she has as good an idea of breakfast as a Scotch-woman. What have</p><p>you here, Watson?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œHam and eggs,â€? I answered.</p><br/><p>â€œGood! What are you going to take, Mr. Phelpsâ€”curried fowl or</p><p>eggs, or will you help yourself?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThank you. I can eat nothing,â€? said Phelps.</p><br/><p>â€œOh, come! Try the dish before you.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThank you, I would really rather not.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, then,â€? said Holmes, with a mischievous twinkle, â€œI suppose</p><p>that you have no objection to helping me?â€?</p><br/><p>Phelps raised the cover, and as he did so he uttered a scream,</p><p>and sat there staring with a face as white as the plate upon</p><p>which he looked. Across the centre of it was lying a little</p><p>cylinder of blue-grey paper. He caught it up, devoured it with</p><p>his eyes, and then danced madly about the room, pressing it to</p><p>his bosom and shrieking out in his delight. Then he fell back</p><p>into an armchair so limp and exhausted with his own emotions that</p><p>we had to pour brandy down his throat to keep him from fainting.</p><br/><p>â€œThere! there!â€? said Holmes, soothing, patting him upon the</p><p>shoulder. â€œIt was too bad to spring it on you like this, but</p><p>Watson here will tell you that I never can resist a touch of the</p><p>dramatic.â€?</p><br/><p>Phelps seized his hand and kissed it. â€œGod bless you!â€? he cried.</p><p>â€œYou have saved my honour.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, my own was at stake, you know,â€? said Holmes. â€œI assure you</p><p>it is just as hateful to me to fail in a case as it can be to you</p><p>to blunder over a commission.â€?</p><br/><p>Phelps thrust away the precious document into the innermost</p><p>pocket of his coat.</p><br/><p>â€œI have not the heart to interrupt your breakfast any further,</p><p>and yet I am dying to know how you got it and where it was.â€?</p><br/><p>Sherlock Holmes swallowed a cup of coffee, and turned his</p><p>attention to the ham and eggs. Then he rose, lit his pipe, and</p><p>settled himself down into his chair.</p><br/><p>â€œIâ€™ll tell you what I did first, and how I came to do it</p><p>afterwards,â€? said he. â€œAfter leaving you at the station I went</p><p>for a charming walk through some admirable Surrey scenery to a</p><p>pretty little village called Ripley, where I had my tea at an</p><p>inn, and took the precaution of filling my flask and of putting a</p><p>paper of sandwiches in my pocket. There I remained until evening,</p><p>when I set off for Woking again, and found myself in the</p><p>high-road outside Briarbrae just after sunset.</p><br/><p>â€œWell, I waited until the road was clearâ€”it is never a very</p><p>frequented one at any time, I fancyâ€”and then I clambered over the</p><p>fence into the grounds.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œSurely the gate was open!â€? ejaculated Phelps.</p><br/><p>â€œYes, but I have a peculiar taste in these matters. I chose the</p><p>place where the three fir-trees stand, and behind their screen I</p><p>got over without the least chance of any one in the house being</p><p>able to see me. I crouched down among the bushes on the other</p><p>side, and crawled from one to the otherâ€”witness the disreputable</p><p>state of my trouser kneesâ€”until I had reached the clump of</p><p>rhododendrons just opposite to your bedroom window. There I</p><p>squatted down and awaited developments.</p><br/><p>â€œThe blind was not down in your room, and I could see Miss</p><p>Harrison sitting there reading by the table. It was quarter-past</p><p>ten when she closed her book, fastened the shutters, and retired.</p><br/><p>â€œI heard her shut the door, and felt quite sure that she had</p><p>turned the key in the lock.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThe key!â€? ejaculated Phelps.</p><br/><p>â€œYes; I had given Miss Harrison instructions to lock the door on</p><p>the outside and take the key with her when she went to bed. She</p><p>carried out every one of my injunctions to the letter, and</p><p>certainly without her co-operation you would not have that paper</p><p>in your coat-pocket. She departed then and the lights went out,</p><p>and I was left squatting in the rhododendron-bush.</p><br/><p>â€œThe night was fine, but still it was a very weary vigil. Of</p><p>course it has the sort of excitement about it that the sportsman</p><p>feels when he lies beside the water-course and waits for the big</p><p>game. It was very long, thoughâ€”almost as long, Watson, as when</p><p>you and I waited in that deadly room when we looked into the</p><p>little problem of the Speckled Band. There was a church-clock</p><p>down at Woking which struck the quarters, and I thought more than</p><p>once that it had stopped. At last however about two in the</p><p>morning, I suddenly heard the gentle sound of a bolt being pushed</p><p>back and the creaking of a key. A moment later the servantsâ€™ door</p><p>was opened, and Mr. Joseph Harrison stepped out into the</p><p>moonlight.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œJoseph!â€? ejaculated Phelps.</p><br/><p>â€œHe was bare-headed, but he had a black coat thrown over his</p><p>shoulder so that he could conceal his face in an instant if there</p><p>were any alarm. He walked on tiptoe under the shadow of the wall,</p><p>and when he reached the window he worked a long-bladed knife</p><p>through the sash and pushed back the catch. Then he flung open</p><p>the window, and putting his knife through the crack in the</p><p>shutters, he thrust the bar up and swung them open.</p><br/><p>â€œFrom where I lay I had a perfect view of the inside of the room</p><p>and of every one of his movements. He lit the two candles which</p><p>stood upon the mantelpiece, and then he proceeded to turn back</p><p>the corner of the carpet in the neighbourhood of the door.</p><p>Presently he stopped and picked out a square piece of board, such</p><p>as is usually left to enable plumbers to get at the joints of the</p><p>gas-pipes. This one covered, as a matter of fact, the T joint</p><p>which gives off the pipe which supplies the kitchen underneath.</p><p>Out of this hiding-place he drew that little cylinder of paper,</p><p>pushed down the board, rearranged the carpet, blew out the</p><p>candles, and walked straight into my arms as I stood waiting for</p><p>him outside the window.</p><br/><p>â€œWell, he has rather more viciousness than I gave him credit for,</p><p>has Master Joseph. He flew at me with his knife, and I had to</p><p>grasp him twice, and got a cut over the knuckles, before I had</p><p>the upper hand of him. He looked murder out of the only eye he</p><p>could see with when we had finished, but he listened to reason</p><p>and gave up the papers. Having got them I let my man go, but I</p><p>wired full particulars to Forbes this morning. If he is quick</p><p>enough to catch his bird, well and good. But if, as I shrewdly</p><p>suspect, he finds the nest empty before he gets there, why, all</p><p>the better for the government. I fancy that Lord Holdhurst for</p><p>one, and Mr. Percy Phelps for another, would very much rather</p><p>that the affair never got as far as a police-court.</p><br/><p>â€œMy God!â€? gasped our client. â€œDo you tell me that during these</p><p>long ten weeks of agony the stolen papers were within the very</p><p>room with me all the time?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œSo it was.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAnd Joseph! Joseph a villain and a thief!â€?</p><br/><p>â€œHum! I am afraid Josephâ€™s character is a rather deeper and more</p><p>dangerous one than one might judge from his appearance. From what</p><p>I have heard from him this morning, I gather that he has lost</p><p>heavily in dabbling with stocks, and that he is ready to do</p><p>anything on earth to better his fortunes. Being an absolutely</p><p>selfish man, when a chance presented itself he did not allow</p><p>either his sisterâ€™s happiness or your reputation to hold his</p><p>hand.â€?</p><br/><p>Percy Phelps sank back in his chair. â€œMy head whirls,â€? said he.</p><p>â€œYour words have dazed me.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThe principal difficulty in your case,â€? remarked Holmes, in his</p><p>didactic fashion, â€œlay in the fact of there being too much</p><p>evidence. What was vital was overlaid and hidden by what was</p><p>irrelevant. Of all the facts which were presented to us we had to</p><p>pick just those which we deemed to be essential, and then piece</p><p>them together in their order, so as to reconstruct this very</p><p>remarkable chain of events. I had already begun to suspect</p><p>Joseph, from the fact that you had intended to travel home with</p><p>him that night, and that therefore it was a likely enough thing</p><p>that he should call for you, knowing the Foreign Office well,</p><p>upon his way. When I heard that some one had been so anxious to</p><p>get into the bedroom, in which no one but Joseph could have</p><p>concealed anythingâ€”you told us in your narrative how you had</p><p>turned Joseph out when you arrived with the doctorâ€”my suspicions</p><p>all changed to certainties, especially as the attempt was made on</p><p>the first night upon which the nurse was absent, showing that the</p><p>intruder was well acquainted with the ways of the house.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œHow blind I have been!â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThe facts of the case, as far as I have worked them out, are</p><p>these: this Joseph Harrison entered the office through the</p><p>Charles Street door, and knowing his way he walked straight into</p><p>your room the instant after you left it. Finding no one there he</p><p>promptly rang the bell, and at the instant that he did so his</p><p>eyes caught the paper upon the table. A glance showed him that</p><p>chance had put in his way a State document of immense value, and</p><p>in an instant he had thrust it into his pocket and was gone. A</p><p>few minutes elapsed, as you remember, before the sleepy</p><p>commissionnaire drew your attention to the bell, and those were</p><p>just enough to give the thief time to make his escape.</p><br/><p>â€œHe made his way to Woking by the first train, and having</p><p>examined his booty and assured himself that it really was of</p><p>immense value, he had concealed it in what he thought was a very</p><p>safe place, with the intention of taking it out again in a day or</p><p>two, and carrying it to the French embassy, or wherever he</p><p>thought that a long price was to be had. Then came your sudden</p><p>return. He, without a momentâ€™s warning, was bundled out of his</p><p>room, and from that time onward there were always at least two of</p><p>you there to prevent him from regaining his treasure. The</p><p>situation to him must have been a maddening one. But at last he</p><p>thought he saw his chance. He tried to steal in, but was baffled</p><p>by your wakefulness. You remember that you did not take your</p><p>usual draught that night.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI remember.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI fancy that he had taken steps to make that draught</p><p>efficacious, and that he quite relied upon your being</p><p>unconscious. Of course, I understood that he would repeat the</p><p>attempt whenever it could be done with safety. Your leaving the</p><p>room gave him the chance he wanted. I kept Miss Harrison in it</p><p>all day so that he might not anticipate us. Then, having given</p><p>him the idea that the coast was clear, I kept guard as I have</p><p>described. I already knew that the papers were probably in the</p><p>room, but I had no desire to rip up all the planking and skirting</p><p>in search of them. I let him take them, therefore, from the</p><p>hiding-place, and so saved myself an infinity of trouble. Is</p><p>there any other point which I can make clear?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWhy did he try the window on the first occasion,â€? I asked, â€œwhen</p><p>he might have entered by the door?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIn reaching the door he would have to pass seven bedrooms. On</p><p>the other hand, he could get out on to the lawn with ease.</p><p>Anything else?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYou do not think,â€? asked Phelps, â€œthat he had any murderous</p><p>intention? The knife was only meant as a tool.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIt may be so,â€? answered Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. â€œI can</p><p>only say for certain that Mr. Joseph Harrison is a gentleman to</p><p>whose mercy I should be extremely unwilling to trust.â€?</p></body>
