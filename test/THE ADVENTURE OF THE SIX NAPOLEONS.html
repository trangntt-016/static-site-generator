<body><h1>THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS</h1><br/><br/><p>It was no very unusual thing for Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard,</p><p>to look in upon us of an evening, and his visits were welcome to</p><p>Sherlock Holmes, for they enabled him to keep in touch with all</p><p>that was going on at the police headquarters. In return for the</p><p>news which Lestrade would bring, Holmes was always ready to</p><p>listen with attention to the details of any case upon which the</p><p>detective was engaged, and was able occasionally, without any</p><p>active interference, to give some hint or suggestion drawn from</p><p>his own vast knowledge and experience.</p><br/><p>On this particular evening, Lestrade had spoken of the weather</p><p>and the newspapers. Then he had fallen silent, puffing</p><p>thoughtfully at his cigar. Holmes looked keenly at him.</p><br/><p>â€œAnything remarkable on hand?â€? he asked.</p><br/><p>â€œOh, no, Mr. Holmesâ€”nothing very particular.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThen tell me about it.â€?</p><br/><p>Lestrade laughed.</p><br/><p>â€œWell, Mr. Holmes, there is no use denying that there _is_</p><p>something on my mind. And yet it is such an absurd business, that</p><p>I hesitated to bother you about it. On the other hand, although</p><p>it is trivial, it is undoubtedly queer, and I know that you have</p><p>a taste for all that is out of the common. But, in my opinion, it</p><p>comes more in Dr. Watsonâ€™s line than ours.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œDisease?â€? said I.</p><br/><p>â€œMadness, anyhow. And a queer madness, too. You wouldnâ€™t think</p><p>there was anyone living at this time of day who had such a hatred</p><p>of Napoleon the First that he would break any image of him that</p><p>he could see.â€?</p><br/><p>Holmes sank back in his chair.</p><br/><p>â€œThatâ€™s no business of mine,â€? said he.</p><br/><p>â€œExactly. Thatâ€™s what I said. But then, when the man commits</p><p>burglary in order to break images which are not his own, that</p><p>brings it away from the doctor and on to the policeman.â€?</p><br/><p>Holmes sat up again.</p><br/><p>â€œBurglary! This is more interesting. Let me hear the details.â€?</p><br/><p>Lestrade took out his official notebook and refreshed his memory</p><p>from its pages.</p><br/><p>â€œThe first case reported was four days ago,â€? said he. â€œIt was at</p><p>the shop of Morse Hudson, who has a place for the sale of</p><p>pictures and statues in the Kennington Road. The assistant had</p><p>left the front shop for an instant, when he heard a crash, and</p><p>hurrying in he found a plaster bust of Napoleon, which stood with</p><p>several other works of art upon the counter, lying shivered into</p><p>fragments. He rushed out into the road, but, although several</p><p>passers-by declared that they had noticed a man run out of the</p><p>shop, he could neither see anyone nor could he find any means of</p><p>identifying the rascal. It seemed to be one of those senseless</p><p>acts of hooliganism which occur from time to time, and it was</p><p>reported to the constable on the beat as such. The plaster cast</p><p>was not worth more than a few shillings, and the whole affair</p><p>appeared to be too childish for any particular investigation.</p><br/><p>â€œThe second case, however, was more serious, and also more</p><p>singular. It occurred only last night.</p><br/><p>â€œIn Kennington Road, and within a few hundred yards of Morse</p><p>Hudsonâ€™s shop, there lives a well-known medical practitioner,</p><p>named Dr. Barnicot, who has one of the largest practices upon the</p><p>south side of the Thames. His residence and principal</p><p>consulting-room is at Kennington Road, but he has a branch</p><p>surgery and dispensary at Lower Brixton Road, two miles away.</p><p>This Dr. Barnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of Napoleon, and his</p><p>house is full of books, pictures, and relics of the French</p><p>Emperor. Some little time ago he purchased from Morse Hudson two</p><p>duplicate plaster casts of the famous head of Napoleon by the</p><p>French sculptor, Devine. One of these he placed in his hall in</p><p>the house at Kennington Road, and the other on the mantelpiece of</p><p>the surgery at Lower Brixton. Well, when Dr. Barnicot came down</p><p>this morning he was astonished to find that his house had been</p><p>burgled during the night, but that nothing had been taken save</p><p>the plaster head from the hall. It had been carried out and had</p><p>been dashed savagely against the garden wall, under which its</p><p>splintered fragments were discovered.â€?</p><br/><p>Holmes rubbed his hands.</p><br/><p>â€œThis is certainly very novel,â€? said he.</p><br/><p>â€œI thought it would please you. But I have not got to the end</p><p>yet. Dr. Barnicot was due at his surgery at twelve oâ€™clock, and</p><p>you can imagine his amazement when, on arriving there, he found</p><p>that the window had been opened in the night and that the broken</p><p>pieces of his second bust were strewn all over the room. It had</p><p>been smashed to atoms where it stood. In neither case were there</p><p>any signs which could give us a clue as to the criminal or</p><p>lunatic who had done the mischief. Now, Mr. Holmes, you have got</p><p>the facts.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThey are singular, not to say grotesque,â€? said Holmes. â€œMay I</p><p>ask whether the two busts smashed in Dr. Barnicotâ€™s rooms were</p><p>the exact duplicates of the one which was destroyed in Morse</p><p>Hudsonâ€™s shop?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThey were taken from the same mould.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œSuch a fact must tell against the theory that the man who breaks</p><p>them is influenced by any general hatred of Napoleon. Considering</p><p>how many hundreds of statues of the great Emperor must exist in</p><p>London, it is too much to suppose such a coincidence as that a</p><p>promiscuous iconoclast should chance to begin upon three</p><p>specimens of the same bust.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, I thought as you do,â€? said Lestrade. â€œOn the other hand,</p><p>this Morse Hudson is the purveyor of busts in that part of</p><p>London, and these three were the only ones which had been in his</p><p>shop for years. So, although, as you say, there are many hundreds</p><p>of statues in London, it is very probable that these three were</p><p>the only ones in that district. Therefore, a local fanatic would</p><p>begin with them. What do you think, Dr. Watson?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThere are no limits to the possibilities of monomania,â€? I</p><p>answered. â€œThere is the condition which the modern French</p><p>psychologists have called the _idÃ©e fixe_, which may be trifling</p><p>in character, and accompanied by complete sanity in every other</p><p>way. A man who had read deeply about Napoleon, or who had</p><p>possibly received some hereditary family injury through the great</p><p>war, might conceivably form such an _idÃ©e fixe_ and under its</p><p>influence be capable of any fantastic outrage.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThat wonâ€™t do, my dear Watson,â€? said Holmes, shaking his head,</p><p>â€œfor no amount of _idÃ©e fixe_ would enable your interesting</p><p>monomaniac to find out where these busts were situated.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, how do _you_ explain it?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI donâ€™t attempt to do so. I would only observe that there is a</p><p>certain method in the gentlemanâ€™s eccentric proceedings. For</p><p>example, in Dr. Barnicotâ€™s hall, where a sound might arouse the</p><p>family, the bust was taken outside before being broken, whereas</p><p>in the surgery, where there was less danger of an alarm, it was</p><p>smashed where it stood. The affair seems absurdly trifling, and</p><p>yet I dare call nothing trivial when I reflect that some of my</p><p>most classic cases have had the least promising commencement. You</p><p>will remember, Watson, how the dreadful business of the Abernetty</p><p>family was first brought to my notice by the depth which the</p><p>parsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot day. I canâ€™t afford,</p><p>therefore, to smile at your three broken busts, Lestrade, and I</p><p>shall be very much obliged to you if you will let me hear of any</p><p>fresh development of so singular a chain of events.â€?</p><br/><p>The development for which my friend had asked came in a quicker</p><p>and an infinitely more tragic form than he could have imagined. I</p><p>was still dressing in my bedroom next morning, when there was a</p><p>tap at the door and Holmes entered, a telegram in his hand. He</p><p>read it aloud:</p><br/><p>â€œCome instantly, 131, Pitt Street, Kensington.â€”LESTRADE.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWhat is it, then?â€? I asked.</p><br/><p>â€œDonâ€™t knowâ€”may be anything. But I suspect it is the sequel of</p><p>the story of the statues. In that case our friend the</p><p>image-breaker has begun operations in another quarter of London.</p><p>Thereâ€™s coffee on the table, Watson, and I have a cab at the</p><p>door.â€?</p><br/><p>In half an hour we had reached Pitt Street, a quiet little</p><p>backwater just beside one of the briskest currents of London</p><p>life. No. 131 was one of a row, all flat-chested, respectable,</p><p>and most unromantic dwellings. As we drove up, we found the</p><p>railings in front of the house lined by a curious crowd. Holmes</p><p>whistled.</p><br/><p>â€œBy George! Itâ€™s attempted murder at the least. Nothing less will</p><p>hold the London message-boy. Thereâ€™s a deed of violence indicated</p><p>in that fellowâ€™s round shoulders and outstretched neck. Whatâ€™s</p><p>this, Watson? The top steps swilled down and the other ones dry.</p><p>Footsteps enough, anyhow! Well, well, thereâ€™s Lestrade at the</p><p>front window, and we shall soon know all about it.â€?</p><br/><p>The official received us with a very grave face and showed us</p><p>into a sitting-room, where an exceedingly unkempt and agitated</p><p>elderly man, clad in a flannel dressing-gown, was pacing up and</p><p>down. He was introduced to us as the owner of the houseâ€”Mr.</p><p>Horace Harker, of the Central Press Syndicate.</p><br/><p>â€œItâ€™s the Napoleon bust business again,â€? said Lestrade. â€œYou</p><p>seemed interested last night, Mr. Holmes, so I thought perhaps</p><p>you would be glad to be present now that the affair has taken a</p><p>very much graver turn.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWhat has it turned to, then?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œTo murder. Mr. Harker, will you tell these gentlemen exactly</p><p>what has occurred?â€?</p><br/><p>The man in the dressing-gown turned upon us with a most</p><p>melancholy face.</p><br/><p>â€œItâ€™s an extraordinary thing,â€? said he, â€œthat all my life I have</p><p>been collecting other peopleâ€™s news, and now that a real piece of</p><p>news has come my own way I am so confused and bothered that I</p><p>canâ€™t put two words together. If I had come in here as a</p><p>journalist, I should have interviewed myself and had two columns</p><p>in every evening paper. As it is, I am giving away valuable copy</p><p>by telling my story over and over to a string of different</p><p>people, and I can make no use of it myself. However, Iâ€™ve heard</p><p>your name, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and if youâ€™ll only explain this</p><p>queer business, I shall be paid for my trouble in telling you the</p><p>story.â€?</p><br/><p>Holmes sat down and listened.</p><br/><p>â€œIt all seems to centre round that bust of Napoleon which I</p><p>bought for this very room about four months ago. I picked it up</p><p>cheap from Harding Brothers, two doors from the High Street</p><p>Station. A great deal of my journalistic work is done at night,</p><p>and I often write until the early morning. So it was to-day. I</p><p>was sitting in my den, which is at the back of the top of the</p><p>house, about three oâ€™clock, when I was convinced that I heard</p><p>some sounds downstairs. I listened, but they were not repeated,</p><p>and I concluded that they came from outside. Then suddenly, about</p><p>five minutes later, there came a most horrible yellâ€”the most</p><p>dreadful sound, Mr. Holmes, that ever I heard. It will ring in my</p><p>ears as long as I live. I sat frozen with horror for a minute or</p><p>two. Then I seized the poker and went downstairs. When I entered</p><p>this room I found the window wide open, and I at once observed</p><p>that the bust was gone from the mantelpiece. Why any burglar</p><p>should take such a thing passes my understanding, for it was only</p><p>a plaster cast and of no real value whatever.</p><br/><p>â€œYou can see for yourself that anyone going out through that open</p><p>window could reach the front doorstep by taking a long stride.</p><p>This was clearly what the burglar had done, so I went round and</p><p>opened the door. Stepping out into the dark, I nearly fell over a</p><p>dead man, who was lying there. I ran back for a light and there</p><p>was the poor fellow, a great gash in his throat and the whole</p><p>place swimming in blood. He lay on his back, his knees drawn up,</p><p>and his mouth horribly open. I shall see him in my dreams. I had</p><p>just time to blow on my police-whistle, and then I must have</p><p>fainted, for I knew nothing more until I found the policeman</p><p>standing over me in the hall.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, who was the murdered man?â€? asked Holmes.</p><br/><p>â€œThereâ€™s nothing to show who he was,â€? said Lestrade. â€œYou shall</p><p>see the body at the mortuary, but we have made nothing of it up</p><p>to now. He is a tall man, sunburned, very powerful, not more than</p><p>thirty. He is poorly dressed, and yet does not appear to be a</p><p>labourer. A horn-handled clasp knife was lying in a pool of blood</p><p>beside him. Whether it was the weapon which did the deed, or</p><p>whether it belonged to the dead man, I do not know. There was no</p><p>name on his clothing, and nothing in his pockets save an apple,</p><p>some string, a shilling map of London, and a photograph. Here it</p><p>is.â€?</p><br/><p>It was evidently taken by a snapshot from a small camera. It</p><p>represented an alert, sharp-featured simian man, with thick</p><p>eyebrows and a very peculiar projection of the lower part of the</p><p>face, like the muzzle of a baboon.</p><br/><p>â€œAnd what became of the bust?â€? asked Holmes, after a careful</p><p>study of this picture.</p><br/><p>â€œWe had news of it just before you came. It has been found in the</p><p>front garden of an empty house in Campden House Road. It was</p><p>broken into fragments. I am going round now to see it. Will you</p><p>come?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œCertainly. I must just take one look round.â€? He examined the</p><p>carpet and the window. â€œThe fellow had either very long legs or</p><p>was a most active man,â€? said he. â€œWith an area beneath, it was no</p><p>mean feat to reach that window ledge and open that window.</p><p>Getting back was comparatively simple. Are you coming with us to</p><p>see the remains of your bust, Mr. Harker?â€?</p><br/><p>The disconsolate journalist had seated himself at a</p><p>writing-table.</p><br/><p>â€œI must try and make something of it,â€? said he, â€œthough I have no</p><p>doubt that the first editions of the evening papers are out</p><p>already with full details. Itâ€™s like my luck! You remember when</p><p>the stand fell at Doncaster? Well, I was the only journalist in</p><p>the stand, and my journal the only one that had no account of it,</p><p>for I was too shaken to write it. And now Iâ€™ll be too late with a</p><p>murder done on my own doorstep.â€?</p><br/><p>As we left the room, we heard his pen travelling shrilly over the</p><p>foolscap.</p><br/><p>The spot where the fragments of the bust had been found was only</p><p>a few hundred yards away. For the first time our eyes rested upon</p><p>this presentment of the great emperor, which seemed to raise such</p><p>frantic and destructive hatred in the mind of the unknown. It lay</p><p>scattered, in splintered shards, upon the grass. Holmes picked up</p><p>several of them and examined them carefully. I was convinced,</p><p>from his intent face and his purposeful manner, that at last he</p><p>was upon a clue.</p><br/><p>â€œWell?â€? asked Lestrade.</p><br/><p>Holmes shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>â€œWe have a long way to go yet,â€? said he. â€œAnd yetâ€”and yetâ€”well,</p><p>we have some suggestive facts to act upon. The possession of this</p><p>trifling bust was worth more, in the eyes of this strange</p><p>criminal, than a human life. That is one point. Then there is the</p><p>singular fact that he did not break it in the house, or</p><p>immediately outside the house, if to break it was his sole</p><p>object.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œHe was rattled and bustled by meeting this other fellow. He</p><p>hardly knew what he was doing.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, thatâ€™s likely enough. But I wish to call your attention</p><p>very particularly to the position of this house, in the garden of</p><p>which the bust was destroyed.â€?</p><br/><p>Lestrade looked about him.</p><br/><p>â€œIt was an empty house, and so he knew that he would not be</p><p>disturbed in the garden.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYes, but there is another empty house farther up the street</p><p>which he must have passed before he came to this one. Why did he</p><p>not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he</p><p>carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI give it up,â€? said Lestrade.</p><br/><p>Holmes pointed to the street lamp above our heads.</p><br/><p>â€œHe could see what he was doing here, and he could not there.</p><p>That was his reason.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œBy Jove! thatâ€™s true,â€? said the detective. â€œNow that I come to</p><p>think of it, Dr. Barnicotâ€™s bust was broken not far from his red</p><p>lamp. Well, Mr. Holmes, what are we to do with that fact?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œTo remember itâ€”to docket it. We may come on something later</p><p>which will bear upon it. What steps do you propose to take now,</p><p>Lestrade?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThe most practical way of getting at it, in my opinion, is to</p><p>identify the dead man. There should be no difficulty about that.</p><p>When we have found who he is and who his associates are, we</p><p>should have a good start in learning what he was doing in Pitt</p><p>Street last night, and who it was who met him and killed him on</p><p>the doorstep of Mr. Horace Harker. Donâ€™t you think so?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œNo doubt; and yet it is not quite the way in which I should</p><p>approach the case.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWhat would you do then?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œOh, you must not let me influence you in any way. I suggest that</p><p>you go on your line and I on mine. We can compare notes</p><p>afterwards, and each will supplement the other.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œVery good,â€? said Lestrade.</p><br/><p>â€œIf you are going back to Pitt Street, you might see Mr. Horace</p><p>Harker. Tell him for me that I have quite made up my mind, and</p><p>that it is certain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic, with</p><p>Napoleonic delusions, was in his house last night. It will be</p><p>useful for his article.â€?</p><br/><p>Lestrade stared.</p><br/><p>â€œYou donâ€™t seriously believe that?â€?</p><br/><p>Holmes smiled.</p><br/><p>â€œDonâ€™t I? Well, perhaps I donâ€™t. But I am sure that it will</p><p>interest Mr. Horace Harker and the subscribers of the Central</p><p>Press Syndicate. Now, Watson, I think that we shall find that we</p><p>have a long and rather complex dayâ€™s work before us. I should be</p><p>glad, Lestrade, if you could make it convenient to meet us at</p><p>Baker Street at six oâ€™clock this evening. Until then I should</p><p>like to keep this photograph, found in the dead manâ€™s pocket. It</p><p>is possible that I may have to ask your company and assistance</p><p>upon a small expedition which will have be undertaken to-night,</p><p>if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct. Until then</p><p>good-bye and good luck!â€?</p><br/><p>Sherlock Holmes and I walked together to the High Street, where</p><p>we stopped at the shop of Harding Brothers, whence the bust had</p><p>been purchased. A young assistant informed us that Mr. Harding</p><p>would be absent until afternoon, and that he was himself a</p><p>newcomer, who could give us no information. Holmesâ€™s face showed</p><p>his disappointment and annoyance.</p><br/><p>â€œWell, well, we canâ€™t expect to have it all our own way, Watson,â€?</p><p>he said, at last. â€œWe must come back in the afternoon, if Mr.</p><p>Harding will not be here until then. I am, as you have no doubt</p><p>surmised, endeavouring to trace these busts to their source, in</p><p>order to find if there is not something peculiar which may</p><p>account for their remarkable fate. Let us make for Mr. Morse</p><p>Hudson, of the Kennington Road, and see if he can throw any light</p><p>upon the problem.â€?</p><br/><p>A drive of an hour brought us to the picture-dealerâ€™s</p><p>establishment. He was a small, stout man with a red face and a</p><p>peppery manner.</p><br/><p>â€œYes, sir. On my very counter, sir,â€? said he. â€œWhat we pay rates</p><p>and taxes for I donâ€™t know, when any ruffian can come in and</p><p>break oneâ€™s goods. Yes, sir, it was I who sold Dr. Barnicot his</p><p>two statues. Disgraceful, sir! A Nihilist plotâ€”thatâ€™s what I make</p><p>it. No one but an anarchist would go about breaking statues. Red</p><p>republicansâ€”thatâ€™s what I call â€™em. Who did I get the statues</p><p>from? I donâ€™t see what that has to do with it. Well, if you</p><p>really want to know, I got them from Gelder & Co., in Church</p><p>Street, Stepney. They are a well-known house in the trade, and</p><p>have been this twenty years. How many had I? Threeâ€”two and one</p><p>are threeâ€”two of Dr. Barnicotâ€™s, and one smashed in broad</p><p>daylight on my own counter. Do I know that photograph? No, I</p><p>donâ€™t. Yes, I do, though. Why, itâ€™s Beppo. He was a kind of</p><p>Italian piece-work man, who made himself useful in the shop. He</p><p>could carve a bit, and gild and frame, and do odd jobs. The</p><p>fellow left me last week, and Iâ€™ve heard nothing of him since.</p><p>No, I donâ€™t know where he came from nor where he went to. I had</p><p>nothing against him while he was here. He was gone two days</p><p>before the bust was smashed.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, thatâ€™s all we could reasonably expect from Morse Hudson,â€?</p><p>said Holmes, as we emerged from the shop. â€œWe have this Beppo as</p><p>a common factor, both in Kennington and in Kensington, so that is</p><p>worth a ten-mile drive. Now, Watson, let us make for Gelder &</p><p>Co., of Stepney, the source and origin of the busts. I shall be</p><p>surprised if we donâ€™t get some help down there.â€?</p><br/><p>In rapid succession we passed through the fringe of fashionable</p><p>London, hotel London, theatrical London, literary London,</p><p>commercial London, and, finally, maritime London, till we came to</p><p>a riverside city of a hundred thousand souls, where the tenement</p><p>houses swelter and reek with the outcasts of Europe. Here, in a</p><p>broad thoroughfare, once the abode of wealthy City merchants, we</p><p>found the sculpture works for which we searched. Outside was a</p><p>considerable yard full of monumental masonry. Inside was a large</p><p>room in which fifty workers were carving or moulding. The</p><p>manager, a big blond German, received us civilly and gave a clear</p><p>answer to all Holmesâ€™s questions. A reference to his books showed</p><p>that hundreds of casts had been taken from a marble copy of</p><p>Devineâ€™s head of Napoleon, but that the three which had been sent</p><p>to Morse Hudson a year or so before had been half of a batch of</p><p>six, the other three being sent to Harding Brothers, of</p><p>Kensington. There was no reason why those six should be different</p><p>from any of the other casts. He could suggest no possible cause</p><p>why anyone should wish to destroy themâ€”in fact, he laughed at the</p><p>idea. Their wholesale price was six shillings, but the retailer</p><p>would get twelve or more. The cast was taken in two moulds from</p><p>each side of the face, and then these two profiles of plaster of</p><p>Paris were joined together to make the complete bust. The work</p><p>was usually done by Italians, in the room we were in. When</p><p>finished, the busts were put on a table in the passage to dry,</p><p>and afterwards stored. That was all he could tell us.</p><br/><p>But the production of the photograph had a remarkable effect upon</p><p>the manager. His face flushed with anger, and his brows knotted</p><p>over his blue Teutonic eyes.</p><br/><p>â€œAh, the rascal!â€? he cried. â€œYes, indeed, I know him very well.</p><p>This has always been a respectable establishment, and the only</p><p>time that we have ever had the police in it was over this very</p><p>fellow. It was more than a year ago now. He knifed another</p><p>Italian in the street, and then he came to the works with the</p><p>police on his heels, and he was taken here. Beppo was his</p><p>nameâ€”his second name I never knew. Serve me right for engaging a</p><p>man with such a face. But he was a good workmanâ€”one of the best.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWhat did he get?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThe man lived and he got off with a year. I have no doubt he is</p><p>out now, but he has not dared to show his nose here. We have a</p><p>cousin of his here, and I daresay he could tell you where he is.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œNo, no,â€? cried Holmes, â€œnot a word to the cousinâ€”not a word, I</p><p>beg of you. The matter is very important, and the farther I go</p><p>with it, the more important it seems to grow. When you referred</p><p>in your ledger to the sale of those casts I observed that the</p><p>date was June 3rd of last year. Could you give me the date when</p><p>Beppo was arrested?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI could tell you roughly by the pay-list,â€? the manager answered.</p><p>â€œYes,â€? he continued, after some turning over of pages, â€œhe was</p><p>paid last on May 20th.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThank you,â€? said Holmes. â€œI donâ€™t think that I need intrude upon</p><p>your time and patience any more.â€? With a last word of caution</p><p>that he should say nothing as to our researches, we turned our</p><p>faces westward once more.</p><br/><p>The afternoon was far advanced before we were able to snatch a</p><p>hasty luncheon at a restaurant. A news-bill at the entrance</p><p>announced â€œKensington Outrage. Murder by a Madman,â€? and the</p><p>contents of the paper showed that Mr. Horace Harker had got his</p><p>account into print after all. Two columns were occupied with a</p><p>highly sensational and flowery rendering of the whole incident.</p><p>Holmes propped it against the cruet-stand and read it while he</p><p>ate. Once or twice he chuckled.</p><br/><p>â€œThis is all right, Watson,â€? said he. â€œListen to this:</p><br/><p>â€œIt is satisfactory to know that there can be no difference of</p><p>opinion upon this case, since Mr. Lestrade, one of the most</p><p>experienced members of the official force, and Mr. Sherlock</p><p>Holmes, the well-known consulting expert, have each come to the</p><p>conclusion that the grotesque series of incidents, which have</p><p>ended in so tragic a fashion, arise from lunacy rather than from</p><p>deliberate crime. No explanation save mental aberration can cover</p><p>the facts.</p><br/><p>â€œThe Press, Watson, is a most valuable institution, if you only</p><p>know how to use it. And now, if you have quite finished, we will</p><p>hark back to Kensington and see what the manager of Harding</p><p>Brothers has to say on the matter.â€?</p><br/><p>The founder of that great emporium proved to be a brisk, crisp</p><p>little person, very dapper and quick, with a clear head and a</p><p>ready tongue.</p><br/><p>â€œYes, sir, I have already read the account in the evening papers.</p><p>Mr. Horace Harker is a customer of ours. We supplied him with the</p><p>bust some months ago. We ordered three busts of that sort from</p><p>Gelder & Co., of Stepney. They are all sold now. To whom? Oh, I</p><p>daresay by consulting our sales book we could very easily tell</p><p>you. Yes, we have the entries here. One to Mr. Harker you see,</p><p>and one to Mr. Josiah Brown, of Laburnum Lodge, Laburnum Vale,</p><p>Chiswick, and one to Mr. Sandeford, of Lower Grove Road, Reading.</p><p>No, I have never seen this face which you show me in the</p><p>photograph. You would hardly forget it, would you, sir, for Iâ€™ve</p><p>seldom seen an uglier. Have we any Italians on the staff? Yes,</p><p>sir, we have several among our workpeople and cleaners. I daresay</p><p>they might get a peep at that sales book if they wanted to. There</p><p>is no particular reason for keeping a watch upon that book. Well,</p><p>well, itâ€™s a very strange business, and I hope that you will let</p><p>me know if anything comes of your inquiries.â€?</p><br/><p>Holmes had taken several notes during Mr. Hardingâ€™s evidence, and</p><p>I could see that he was thoroughly satisfied by the turn which</p><p>affairs were taking. He made no remark, however, save that,</p><p>unless we hurried, we should be late for our appointment with</p><p>Lestrade. Sure enough, when we reached Baker Street the detective</p><p>was already there, and we found him pacing up and down in a fever</p><p>of impatience. His look of importance showed that his dayâ€™s work</p><p>had not been in vain.</p><br/><p>â€œWell?â€? he asked. â€œWhat luck, Mr. Holmes?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWe have had a very busy day, and not entirely a wasted one,â€? my</p><p>friend explained. â€œWe have seen both the retailers and also the</p><p>wholesale manufacturers. I can trace each of the busts now from</p><p>the beginning.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThe busts,â€? cried Lestrade. â€œWell, well, you have your own</p><p>methods, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and it is not for me to say a word</p><p>against them, but I think I have done a better dayâ€™s work than</p><p>you. I have identified the dead man.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œYou donâ€™t say so?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAnd found a cause for the crime.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œSplendid!â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWe have an inspector who makes a specialty of Saffron Hill and</p><p>the Italian Quarter. Well, this dead man had some Catholic emblem</p><p>round his neck, and that, along with his colour, made me think he</p><p>was from the South. Inspector Hill knew him the moment he caught</p><p>sight of him. His name is Pietro Venucci, from Naples, and he is</p><p>one of the greatest cut-throats in London. He is connected with</p><p>the Mafia, which, as you know, is a secret political society,</p><p>enforcing its decrees by murder. Now, you see how the affair</p><p>begins to clear up. The other fellow is probably an Italian also,</p><p>and a member of the Mafia. He has broken the rules in some</p><p>fashion. Pietro is set upon his track. Probably the photograph we</p><p>found in his pocket is the man himself, so that he may not knife</p><p>the wrong person. He dogs the fellow, he sees him enter a house,</p><p>he waits outside for him, and in the scuffle he receives his own</p><p>death-wound. How is that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?â€?</p><br/><p>Holmes clapped his hands approvingly.</p><br/><p>â€œExcellent, Lestrade, excellent!â€? he cried. â€œBut I didnâ€™t quite</p><p>follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThe busts! You never can get those busts out of your head. After</p><p>all, that is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. It</p><p>is the murder that we are really investigating, and I tell you</p><p>that I am gathering all the threads into my hands.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œAnd the next stage?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIs a very simple one. I shall go down with Hill to the Italian</p><p>Quarter, find the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest</p><p>him on the charge of murder. Will you come with us?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI think not. I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. I</p><p>canâ€™t say for certain, because it all dependsâ€”well, it all</p><p>depends upon a factor which is completely outside our control.</p><p>But I have great hopesâ€”in fact, the betting is exactly two to</p><p>oneâ€”that if you will come with us to-night I shall be able to</p><p>help you to lay him by the heels.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIn the Italian Quarter?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œNo, I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to find</p><p>him. If you will come with me to Chiswick to-night, Lestrade,</p><p>Iâ€™ll promise to go to the Italian Quarter with you to-morrow, and</p><p>no harm will be done by the delay. And now I think that a few</p><p>hoursâ€™ sleep would do us all good, for I do not propose to leave</p><p>before eleven oâ€™clock, and it is unlikely that we shall be back</p><p>before morning. Youâ€™ll dine with us, Lestrade, and then you are</p><p>welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start. In the</p><p>meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you would ring for an</p><p>express messenger, for I have a letter to send and it is</p><p>important that it should go at once.â€?</p><br/><p>Holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the old</p><p>daily papers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed. When</p><p>at last he descended, it was with triumph in his eyes, but he</p><p>said nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches.</p><p>For my own part, I had followed step by step the methods by which</p><p>he had traced the various windings of this complex case, and,</p><p>though I could not yet perceive the goal which we would reach, I</p><p>understood clearly that Holmes expected this grotesque criminal</p><p>to make an attempt upon the two remaining busts, one of which, I</p><p>remembered, was at Chiswick. No doubt the object of our journey</p><p>was to catch him in the very act, and I could not but admire the</p><p>cunning with which my friend had inserted a wrong clue in the</p><p>evening paper, so as to give the fellow the idea that he could</p><p>continue his scheme with impunity. I was not surprised when</p><p>Holmes suggested that I should take my revolver with me. He had</p><p>himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop, which was his</p><p>favourite weapon.</p><br/><p>A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove to a</p><p>spot at the other side of Hammersmith Bridge. Here the cabman was</p><p>directed to wait. A short walk brought us to a secluded road</p><p>fringed with pleasant houses, each standing in its own grounds.</p><p>In the light of a street lamp we read â€œLaburnum Villaâ€? upon the</p><p>gate-post of one of them. The occupants had evidently retired to</p><p>rest, for all was dark save for a fanlight over the hall door,</p><p>which shed a single blurred circle on to the garden path. The</p><p>wooden fence which separated the grounds from the road threw a</p><p>dense black shadow upon the inner side, and here it was that we</p><p>crouched.</p><br/><p>â€œI fear that youâ€™ll have a long wait,â€? Holmes whispered. â€œWe may</p><p>thank our stars that it is not raining. I donâ€™t think we can even</p><p>venture to smoke to pass the time. However, itâ€™s a two to one</p><p>chance that we get something to pay us for our trouble.â€?</p><br/><p>It proved, however, that our vigil was not to be so long as</p><p>Holmes had led us to fear, and it ended in a very sudden and</p><p>singular fashion. In an instant, without the least sound to warn</p><p>us of his coming, the garden gate swung open, and a lithe, dark</p><p>figure, as swift and active as an ape, rushed up the garden path.</p><p>We saw it whisk past the light thrown from over the door and</p><p>disappear against the black shadow of the house. There was a long</p><p>pause, during which we held our breath, and then a very gentle</p><p>creaking sound came to our ears. The window was being opened. The</p><p>noise ceased, and again there was a long silence. The fellow was</p><p>making his way into the house. We saw the sudden flash of a dark</p><p>lantern inside the room. What he sought was evidently not there,</p><p>for again we saw the flash through another blind, and then</p><p>through another.</p><br/><p>â€œLet us get to the open window. We will nab him as he climbs</p><p>out,â€? Lestrade whispered.</p><br/><p>But before we could move, the man had emerged again. As he came</p><p>out into the glimmering patch of light, we saw that he carried</p><p>something white under his arm. He looked stealthily all round</p><p>him. The silence of the deserted street reassured him. Turning</p><p>his back upon us he laid down his burden, and the next instant</p><p>there was the sound of a sharp tap, followed by a clatter and</p><p>rattle. The man was so intent upon what he was doing that he</p><p>never heard our steps as we stole across the grass plot. With the</p><p>bound of a tiger Holmes was on his back, and an instant later</p><p>Lestrade and I had him by either wrist, and the handcuffs had</p><p>been fastened. As we turned him over I saw a hideous, sallow</p><p>face, with writhing, furious features, glaring up at us, and I</p><p>knew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we had</p><p>secured.</p><br/><p>But it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes was giving his</p><p>attention. Squatted on the doorstep, he was engaged in most</p><p>carefully examining that which the man had brought from the</p><p>house. It was a bust of Napoleon, like the one which we had seen</p><p>that morning, and it had been broken into similar fragments.</p><p>Carefully Holmes held each separate shard to the light, but in no</p><p>way did it differ from any other shattered piece of plaster. He</p><p>had just completed his examination when the hall lights flew up,</p><p>the door opened, and the owner of the house, a jovial, rotund</p><p>figure in shirt and trousers, presented himself.</p><br/><p>â€œMr. Josiah Brown, I suppose?â€? said Holmes.</p><br/><p>â€œYes, sir; and you, no doubt, are Mr. Sherlock Holmes? I had the</p><p>note which you sent by the express messenger, and I did exactly</p><p>what you told me. We locked every door on the inside and awaited</p><p>developments. Well, Iâ€™m very glad to see that you have got the</p><p>rascal. I hope, gentlemen, that you will come in and have some</p><p>refreshment.â€?</p><br/><p>However, Lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe quarters,</p><p>so within a few minutes our cab had been summoned and we were all</p><p>four upon our way to London. Not a word would our captive say,</p><p>but he glared at us from the shadow of his matted hair, and once,</p><p>when my hand seemed within his reach, he snapped at it like a</p><p>hungry wolf. We stayed long enough at the police-station to learn</p><p>that a search of his clothing revealed nothing save a few</p><p>shillings and a long sheath knife, the handle of which bore</p><p>copious traces of recent blood.</p><br/><p>â€œThatâ€™s all right,â€? said Lestrade, as we parted. â€œHill knows all</p><p>these gentry, and he will give a name to him. Youâ€™ll find that my</p><p>theory of the Mafia will work out all right. But Iâ€™m sure I am</p><p>exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Holmes, for the workmanlike way</p><p>in which you laid hands upon him. I donâ€™t quite understand it all</p><p>yet.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations,â€? said</p><p>Holmes. â€œBesides, there are one or two details which are not</p><p>finished off, and it is one of those cases which are worth</p><p>working out to the very end. If you will come round once more to</p><p>my rooms at six oâ€™clock to-morrow, I think I shall be able to</p><p>show you that even now you have not grasped the entire meaning of</p><p>this business, which presents some features which make it</p><p>absolutely original in the history of crime. If ever I permit you</p><p>to chronicle any more of my little problems, Watson, I foresee</p><p>that you will enliven your pages by an account of the singular</p><p>adventure of the Napoleonic busts.â€?</p><br/><p>When we met again next evening, Lestrade was furnished with much</p><p>information concerning our prisoner. His name, it appeared, was</p><p>Beppo, second name unknown. He was a well-known neâ€™er-do-well</p><p>among the Italian colony. He had once been a skilful sculptor and</p><p>had earned an honest living, but he had taken to evil courses and</p><p>had twice already been in jailâ€”once for a petty theft, and once,</p><p>as we had already heard, for stabbing a fellow-countryman. He</p><p>could talk English perfectly well. His reasons for destroying the</p><p>busts were still unknown, and he refused to answer any questions</p><p>upon the subject, but the police had discovered that these same</p><p>busts might very well have been made by his own hands, since he</p><p>was engaged in this class of work at the establishment of Gelder</p><p>& Co. To all this information, much of which we already knew,</p><p>Holmes listened with polite attention, but I, who knew him so</p><p>well, could clearly see that his thoughts were elsewhere, and I</p><p>detected a mixture of mingled uneasiness and expectation beneath</p><p>that mask which he was wont to assume. At last he started in his</p><p>chair, and his eyes brightened. There had been a ring at the</p><p>bell. A minute later we heard steps upon the stairs, and an</p><p>elderly red-faced man with grizzled side-whiskers was ushered in.</p><p>In his right hand he carried an old-fashioned carpet-bag, which</p><p>he placed upon the table.</p><br/><p>â€œIs Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?â€?</p><br/><p>My friend bowed and smiled. â€œMr. Sandeford, of Reading, I</p><p>suppose?â€? said he.</p><br/><p>â€œYes, sir, I fear that I am a little late, but the trains were</p><p>awkward. You wrote to me about a bust that is in my possession.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œExactly.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI have your letter here. You said, â€˜I desire to possess a copy</p><p>of Devineâ€™s Napoleon, and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for</p><p>the one which is in your possession.â€™ Is that right?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œCertainly.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œI was very much surprised at your letter, for I could not</p><p>imagine how you knew that I owned such a thing.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œOf course you must have been surprised, but the explanation is</p><p>very simple. Mr. Harding, of Harding Brothers, said that they had</p><p>sold you their last copy, and he gave me your address.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œOh, that was it, was it? Did he tell you what I paid for it?â€?</p><br/><p>â€œNo, he did not.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, I am an honest man, though not a very rich one. I only</p><p>gave fifteen shillings for the bust, and I think you ought to</p><p>know that before I take ten pounds from you.</p><br/><p>â€œI am sure the scruple does you honour, Mr. Sandeford. But I have</p><p>named that price, so I intend to stick to it.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œWell, it is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes. I brought the bust</p><p>up with me, as you asked me to do. Here it is!â€? He opened his</p><p>bag, and at last we saw placed upon our table a complete specimen</p><p>of that bust which we had already seen more than once in</p><p>fragments.</p><br/><p>Holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten-pound note</p><p>upon the table.</p><br/><p>â€œYou will kindly sign that paper, Mr. Sandeford, in the presence</p><p>of these witnesses. It is simply to say that you transfer every</p><p>possible right that you ever had in the bust to me. I am a</p><p>methodical man, you see, and you never know what turn events</p><p>might take afterwards. Thank you, Mr. Sandeford; here is your</p><p>money, and I wish you a very good evening.â€?</p><br/><p>When our visitor had disappeared, Sherlock Holmesâ€™s movements</p><p>were such as to rivet our attention. He began by taking a clean</p><p>white cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table. Then he</p><p>placed his newly acquired bust in the centre of the cloth.</p><p>Finally, he picked up his hunting-crop and struck Napoleon a</p><p>sharp blow on the top of the head. The figure broke into</p><p>fragments, and Holmes bent eagerly over the shattered remains.</p><p>Next instant, with a loud shout of triumph he held up one</p><p>splinter, in which a round, dark object was fixed like a plum in</p><p>a pudding.</p><br/><p>â€œGentlemen,â€? he cried, â€œlet me introduce you to the famous black</p><p>pearl of the Borgias.â€?</p><br/><p>Lestrade and I sat silent for a moment, and then, with a</p><p>spontaneous impulse, we both broke at clapping, as at the</p><p>well-wrought crisis of a play. A flush of colour sprang to</p><p>Holmesâ€™s pale cheeks, and he bowed to us like the master</p><p>dramatist who receives the homage of his audience. It was at such</p><p>moments that for an instant he ceased to be a reasoning machine,</p><p>and betrayed his human love for admiration and applause. The same</p><p>singularly proud and reserved nature which turned away with</p><p>disdain from popular notoriety was capable of being moved to its</p><p>depths by spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend.</p><br/><p>â€œYes, gentlemen,â€? said he, â€œit is the most famous pearl now</p><p>existing in the world, and it has been my good fortune, by a</p><p>connected chain of inductive reasoning, to trace it from the</p><p>Prince of Colonnaâ€™s bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it was</p><p>lost, to the interior of this, the last of the six busts of</p><p>Napoleon which were manufactured by Gelder & Co., of Stepney. You</p><p>will remember, Lestrade, the sensation caused by the</p><p>disappearance of this valuable jewel and the vain efforts of the</p><p>London police to recover it. I was myself consulted upon the</p><p>case, but I was unable to throw any light upon it. Suspicion fell</p><p>upon the maid of the Princess, who was an Italian, and it was</p><p>proved that she had a brother in London, but we failed to trace</p><p>any connection between them. The maidâ€™s name was Lucretia</p><p>Venucci, and there is no doubt in my mind that this Pietro who</p><p>was murdered two nights ago was the brother. I have been looking</p><p>up the dates in the old files of the paper, and I find that the</p><p>disappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest</p><p>of Beppo, for some crime of violenceâ€”an event which took place in</p><p>the factory of Gelder & Co., at the very moment when these busts</p><p>were being made. Now you clearly see the sequence of events,</p><p>though you see them, of course, in the inverse order to the way</p><p>in which they presented themselves to me. Beppo had the pearl in</p><p>his possession. He may have stolen it from Pietro, he may have</p><p>been Pietroâ€™s confederate, he may have been the go-between of</p><p>Pietro and his sister. It is of no consequence to us which is the</p><p>correct solution.</p><br/><p>â€œThe main fact is that he _had_ the pearl, and at that moment,</p><p>when it was on his person, he was pursued by the police. He made</p><p>for the factory in which he worked, and he knew that he had only</p><p>a few minutes in which to conceal this enormously valuable prize,</p><p>which would otherwise be found on him when he was searched. Six</p><p>plaster casts of Napoleon were drying in the passage. One of them</p><p>was still soft. In an instant Beppo, a skilful workman, made a</p><p>small hole in the wet plaster, dropped in the pearl, and with a</p><p>few touches covered over the aperture once more. It was an</p><p>admirable hiding-place. No one could possibly find it. But Beppo</p><p>was condemned to a yearâ€™s imprisonment, and in the meanwhile his</p><p>six busts were scattered over London. He could not tell which</p><p>contained his treasure. Only by breaking them could he see. Even</p><p>shaking would tell him nothing, for as the plaster was wet it was</p><p>probable that the pearl would adhere to itâ€”as, in fact, it has</p><p>done. Beppo did not despair, and he conducted his search with</p><p>considerable ingenuity and perseverance. Through a cousin who</p><p>works with Gelder, he found out the retail firms who had bought</p><p>the busts. He managed to find employment with Morse Hudson, and</p><p>in that way tracked down three of them. The pearl was not there.</p><p>Then, with the help of some Italian employee, he succeeded in</p><p>finding out where the other three busts had gone. The first was</p><p>at Harkerâ€™s. There he was dogged by his confederate, who held</p><p>Beppo responsible for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him</p><p>in the scuffle which followed.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œIf he was his confederate, why should he carry his photograph?â€?</p><p>I asked.</p><br/><p>â€œAs a means of tracing him, if he wished to inquire about him</p><p>from any third person. That was the obvious reason. Well, after</p><p>the murder I calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather</p><p>than delay his movements. He would fear that the police would</p><p>read his secret, and so he hastened on before they should get</p><p>ahead of him. Of course, I could not say that he had not found</p><p>the pearl in Harkerâ€™s bust. I had not even concluded for certain</p><p>that it was the pearl, but it was evident to me that he was</p><p>looking for something, since he carried the bust past the other</p><p>houses in order to break it in the garden which had a lamp</p><p>overlooking it. Since Harkerâ€™s bust was one in three, the chances</p><p>were exactly as I told youâ€”two to one against the pearl being</p><p>inside it. There remained two busts, and it was obvious that he</p><p>would go for the London one first. I warned the inmates of the</p><p>house, so as to avoid a second tragedy, and we went down, with</p><p>the happiest results. By that time, of course, I knew for certain</p><p>that it was the Borgia pearl that we were after. The name of the</p><p>murdered man linked the one event with the other. There only</p><p>remained a single bustâ€”the Reading oneâ€”and the pearl must be</p><p>there. I bought it in your presence from the ownerâ€”and there it</p><p>lies.â€?</p><br/><p>We sat in silence for a moment.</p><br/><p>â€œWell,â€? said Lestrade, â€œIâ€™ve seen you handle a good many cases,</p><p>Mr. Holmes, but I donâ€™t know that I ever knew a more workmanlike</p><p>one than that. Weâ€™re not jealous of you at Scotland Yard. No,</p><p>sir, we are very proud of you, and if you come down to-morrow,</p><p>thereâ€™s not a man, from the oldest inspector to the youngest</p><p>constable, who wouldnâ€™t be glad to shake you by the hand.â€?</p><br/><p>â€œThank you!â€? said Holmes. â€œThank you!â€? and as he turned away, it</p><p>seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the softer human</p><p>emotions than I had ever seen him. A moment later he was the cold</p><p>and practical thinker once more. â€œPut the pearl in the safe,</p><p>Watson,â€? said he, â€œand get out the papers of the Conk-Singleton</p><p>forgery case. Good-bye, Lestrade. If any little problem comes</p><p>your way, I shall be happy, if I can, to give you a hint or two</p><p>as to its solution.â€?</p></body>
