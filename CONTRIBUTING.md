Contributing
============

Thank you for your interest in contributing to JSSG!

We appreciate your effort and to make sure that your pull request is easy to review, we ask you to note the following
guidelines including legal contributor agreement:

* Use JDK 11, [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), [Maven 3.8.1](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
  , [Picocli 4.6.1](https://picocli.info/) or newer to build the project

* To use Formatter and Eslint in this project, please read this
  detailed [instruction](https://tracy016.medium.com/osd600-adding-static-analysis-toolings-b8488bf239da)

* To enable "auto-test", enable "Toggle auto-test" in run dialog box
![image](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/user_images/35Aia3Dk3aHoTBe1gB8WIw.png)
  This will start auto testing. Although this works fine, it takes time to build the project even when my project is tiny so for larger projects it will certainly take very long time to complete the build and execute tests.

## Legal stuff

* You will only submit contributions to which you have the necessary rights. This means that if you are employed, you
